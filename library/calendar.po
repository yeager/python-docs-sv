msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/calendar.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module allows you to output calendars like the Unix :program:`cal` "
"program, and provides additional useful functions related to the calendar. "
"By default, these calendars have Monday as the first day of the week, and "
"Sunday as the last (the European convention). Use :func:`setfirstweekday` to "
"set the first day of the week to Sunday (6) or to any other weekday.  "
"Parameters that specify dates are given as integers. For related "
"functionality, see also the :mod:`datetime` and :mod:`time` modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The functions and classes defined in this module use an idealized calendar, "
"the current Gregorian calendar extended indefinitely in both directions.  "
"This matches the definition of the \"proleptic Gregorian\" calendar in "
"Dershowitz and Reingold's book \"Calendrical Calculations\", where it's the "
"base calendar for all computations.  Zero and negative years are interpreted "
"as prescribed by the ISO 8601 standard.  Year 0 is 1 BC, year -1 is 2 BC, "
"and so on."
