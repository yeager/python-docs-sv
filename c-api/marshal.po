msgid "Data marshalling support"

msgid ""
"These routines allow C code to work with serialized objects using the same "
"data format as the :mod:`marshal` module.  There are functions to write data "
"into the serialization format, and additional functions that can be used to "
"read the data back.  Files used to store marshalled data must be opened in "
"binary mode."
msgstr ""

msgid "Numeric values are stored with the least significant byte first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module supports several versions of the data format; see the :py:mod:"
"`Python module documentation <marshal>` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "The current format version. See :py:data:`marshal.version`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Marshal a :c:expr:`long` integer, *value*, to *file*.  This will only write "
"the least-significant 32 bits of *value*; regardless of the size of the "
"native :c:expr:`long` type.  *version* indicates the file format."

msgid ""
"This function can fail, in which case it sets the error indicator. Use :c:"
"func:`PyErr_Occurred` to check for that."

msgid ""
"Marshal a Python object, *value*, to *file*. *version* indicates the file "

"Return a bytes object containing the marshalled representation of *value*. "
"*version* indicates the file format."

msgid "The following functions allow marshalled values to be read back in."

msgid ""
"Return a C :c:expr:`long` from the data stream in a :c:expr:`FILE*` opened "
"for reading.  Only a 32-bit value can be read in using this function, "

"On error, sets the appropriate exception (:exc:`EOFError`) and returns "
"``-1``."

msgid ""
"Return a C :c:expr:`short` from the data stream in a :c:expr:`FILE*` opened "
"for reading.  Only a 16-bit value can be read in using this function, "

"Return a Python object from the data stream in a :c:expr:`FILE*` opened for "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a Python object from the data stream in a :c:expr:`FILE*` opened for "
"reading.  Unlike :c:func:`PyMarshal_ReadObjectFromFile`, this function "
"assumes that no further objects will be read from the file, allowing it to "
"aggressively load file data into memory so that the de-serialization can "
"operate from data in memory rather than reading a byte at a time from the "
"file.  Only use these variant if you are certain that you won't be reading "
"anything else from the file."

msgid ""
"Return a Python object from the data stream in a byte buffer containing "
"*len* bytes pointed to by *data*."
