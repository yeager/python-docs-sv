"The :mod:`tty` module defines functions for putting the tty into cbreak and "

"Because it requires the :mod:`termios` module, it will work only on Unix."

msgid "The :mod:`tty` module defines the following functions:"

"Convert the tty attribute list *mode*, which is a list like the one returned "

"Convert the tty attribute list *mode*, which is a list like the one returned "

"This clears the ``ECHO`` and ``ICANON`` local mode flags in *mode* as well "
"as setting the minimum input to 1 byte with no delay."

msgid ""
"The ``ICRNL`` flag is no longer cleared. This matches Linux and macOS ``stty "
"cbreak`` behavior and what :func:`setcbreak` historically did."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Change the mode of the file descriptor *fd* to raw. If *when* is omitted, it "
"defaults to :const:`termios.TCSAFLUSH`, and is passed to :func:`termios."
"tcsetattr`. The return value of :func:`termios.tcgetattr` is saved before "
"setting *fd* to raw mode; this value is returned."
