"You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) "
"reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard "
"library.  The standard Python distribution includes a *lot* of additional "
"code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, "
"generate random numbers, parse command-line options, compress data, and many "
"other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of "
"what's available."
