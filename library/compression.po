msgid ""
"The :mod:`!compression` package contains the canonical compression modules "
"containing interfaces to several different compression algorithms. Some of "
"these modules have historically been available as separate modules; those "
"will continue to be available under their original names for compatibility "
"reasons, and will not be removed without a deprecation cycle. The use of "
"modules in :mod:`!compression` is encouraged where practical."
