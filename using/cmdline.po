"python [-bBdEhiIOPqRsSuvVWx?] [-c command | -m module-name | script | - ] "

msgid ""
"The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell, but provides "

msgid ""
"When called with standard input connected to a tty device, it prompts for "
"commands and executes them until an EOF (an end-of-file character, you can "
"produce that with :kbd:`Ctrl-D` on UNIX or :kbd:`Ctrl-Z, Enter` on Windows) "
"is read. For more on interactive mode, see :ref:`tut-interac`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When called with a directory name argument, it reads and executes an "
"appropriately named script from that directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When called with ``-c command``, it executes the Python statement(s) given "
"as *command*.  Here *command* may contain multiple statements separated by "
"newlines. Leading whitespace is significant in Python statements!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When called with ``-m module-name``, the given module is located on the "
"Python module path and executed as a script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In non-interactive mode, the entire input is parsed before it is executed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An interface option terminates the list of options consumed by the "
"interpreter, all consecutive arguments will end up in :data:`sys.argv` -- "
"note that the first element, subscript zero (``sys.argv[0]``), is a string "
"reflecting the program's source."

"Execute the Python code in *command*.  *command* can be one or more "

"Package names (including namespace packages) are also permitted. When a "
"package name is supplied instead of a normal module, the interpreter will "

"passed to the interpreter as the script argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This option cannot be used with built-in modules and extension modules "
