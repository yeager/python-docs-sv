"The principal challenge of multi-threaded applications is coordinating "
"threads that share data or other resources.  To that end, the threading "
"module provides a number of synchronization primitives including locks, "
"events, condition variables, and semaphores."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While those tools are powerful, minor design errors can result in problems "
"that are difficult to reproduce.  So, the preferred approach to task "
"coordination is to concentrate all access to a resource in a single thread "
"and then use the :mod:`queue` module to feed that thread with requests from "
"other threads. Applications using :class:`~queue.Queue` objects for inter-"
"thread communication and coordination are easier to design, more readable, "
"and more reliable."

msgid "Weak References"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python does automatic memory management (reference counting for most objects "
"and :term:`garbage collection` to eliminate cycles).  The memory is freed "
"shortly after the last reference to it has been eliminated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This approach works fine for most applications but occasionally there is a "
"need to track objects only as long as they are being used by something else. "
"Unfortunately, just tracking them creates a reference that makes them "
"permanent. The :mod:`weakref` module provides tools for tracking objects "
"without creating a reference.  When the object is no longer needed, it is "
"automatically removed from a weakref table and a callback is triggered for "
"weakref objects.  Typical applications include caching objects that are "
"expensive to create::"
