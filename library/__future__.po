"Imports of the form ``from __future__ import feature`` are called :ref:"
"`future statements <future>`. These are special-cased by the Python compiler "
"to allow the use of new Python features in modules containing the future "
"statement before the release in which the feature becomes standard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While these future statements are given additional special meaning by the "
"Python compiler, they are still executed like any other import statement and "
"the :mod:`__future__` exists and is handled by the import system the same "
"way any other Python module would be. This design serves three purposes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid confusing existing tools that analyze import statements and expect "
"to find the modules they're importing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To document when incompatible changes were introduced, and when they will be "
"--- or were --- made mandatory.  This is a form of executable documentation, "
"and can be inspected programmatically via importing :mod:`__future__` and "
"examining its contents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To ensure that :ref:`future statements <future>` run under releases prior to "
