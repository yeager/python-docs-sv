msgid "Interactive Mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two variants of the interactive :term:`REPL`.  The classic basic "
"interpreter is supported on all platforms with minimal line control "
"capabilities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, or Unix-like systems with :mod:`curses` support, a new "
"interactive shell is used by default since Python 3.13. This one supports "
"color, multiline editing, history browsing, and paste mode.  To disable "
"color, see :ref:`using-on-controlling-color` for details.  Function keys "
"provide some additional functionality. :kbd:`F1` enters the interactive help "
"browser :mod:`pydoc`. :kbd:`F2` allows for browsing command-line history "
"with neither output nor the :term:`>>>` and :term:`...` prompts. :kbd:`F3` "
"enters \"paste mode\", which makes pasting larger blocks of code easier. "
"Press :kbd:`F3` to return to the regular prompt."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the new interactive shell, exit the shell by typing :kbd:`exit` "
"or :kbd:`quit`. Adding call parentheses after those commands is not required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the new interactive shell is not desired, it can be disabled via the :"
"envvar:`PYTHON_BASIC_REPL` environment variable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Error Handling"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack "
"trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when "
"input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing "
"the stack trace. (Exceptions handled by an :keyword:`except` clause in a :"
"keyword:`try` statement are not errors in this context.)  Some errors are "
"unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit status; this "
"applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of "
"memory.  All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal "
"output from executed commands is written to standard output."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Typing the interrupt character (usually :kbd:`Control-C` or :kbd:`Delete`) "
"to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the "
"primary prompt. [#]_ Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises "
"the :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception, which may be handled by a :keyword:"
"`try` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid "Executable Python Scripts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On BSD'ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, "
"like shell scripts, by putting the line ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "#!/usr/bin/env python3"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(assuming that the interpreter is on the user's :envvar:`PATH`) at the "
"beginning of the script and giving the file an executable mode.  The ``#!`` "
"must be the first two characters of the file.  On some platforms, this first "
"line must end with a Unix-style line ending (``'\\n'``), not a Windows "
"(``'\\r\\n'``) line ending.  Note that the hash, or pound, character, "
"``'#'``, is used to start a comment in Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The script can be given an executable mode, or permission, using the :"
"program:`chmod` command."
msgstr ""

msgid "$ chmod +x myscript.py"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows systems, there is no notion of an \"executable mode\".  The "
"Python installer automatically associates ``.py`` files with ``python.exe`` "
"so that a double-click on a Python file will run it as a script.  The "
"extension can also be ``.pyw``, in that case, the console window that "
"normally appears is suppressed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Interactive Startup File"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you use Python interactively, it is frequently handy to have some "
"standard commands executed every time the interpreter is started.  You can "
"do this by setting an environment variable named :envvar:`PYTHONSTARTUP` to "
"the name of a file containing your start-up commands.  This is similar to "
"the :file:`.profile` feature of the Unix shells."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This file is only read in interactive sessions, not when Python reads "
"commands from a script, and not when :file:`/dev/tty` is given as the "
"explicit source of commands (which otherwise behaves like an interactive "
"session).  It is executed in the same namespace where interactive commands "
"are executed, so that objects that it defines or imports can be used without "
"qualification in the interactive session. You can also change the prompts "
"``sys.ps1`` and ``sys.ps2`` in this file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to read an additional start-up file from the current directory, "
"you can program this in the global start-up file using code like ``if os."
"path.isfile('.pythonrc.py'): exec(open('.pythonrc.py').read())``. If you "
"want to use the startup file in a script, you must do this explicitly in the "
"script::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"import os\n"
"filename = os.environ.get('PYTHONSTARTUP')\n"
"if filename and os.path.isfile(filename):\n"
"    with open(filename) as fobj:\n"
"        startup_file = fobj.read()\n"
"    exec(startup_file)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Customization Modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python provides two hooks to let you customize it: :index:`sitecustomize` "
"and :index:`usercustomize`.  To see how it works, you need first to find the "
"location of your user site-packages directory.  Start Python and run this "
"code::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> import site\n"
">>> site.getusersitepackages()\n"
"'/home/user/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages'"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can create a file named :file:`usercustomize.py` in that directory "
"and put anything you want in it.  It will affect every invocation of Python, "
"unless it is started with the :option:`-s` option to disable the automatic "
"import."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":index:`sitecustomize` works in the same way, but is typically created by an "
"administrator of the computer in the global site-packages directory, and is "
"imported before :index:`usercustomize`.  See the documentation of the :mod:"
"`site` module for more details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Footnotes"
msgstr ""

msgid "A problem with the GNU Readline package may prevent this."
msgstr ""
