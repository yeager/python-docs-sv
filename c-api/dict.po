"This subtype of :c:type:`PyObject` represents a Python dictionary object."

msgid ""
"This instance of :c:type:`PyTypeObject` represents the Python dictionary "

"Return true if *p* is a dict object, but not an instance of a subtype of the "

msgstr ""

msgid "Return a new empty dictionary, or ``NULL`` on failure."

msgstr ""

msgid "Empty an existing dictionary of all key-value pairs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Determine if dictionary *p* contains *key*.  If an item in *p* is matches "

"to *val*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the same as :c:func:`PyDict_SetItem`, but *key* is specified as a :c:"

"Variant of :c:func:`PyDict_GetItem` that does not suppress exceptions. "

"This is the same as the Python-level :meth:`dict.setdefault`.  If present, "

"*default_value*, if the key was not present, or the existing value, if *key* "
"was already present in the dictionary. Returns ``1`` if the key was present "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For clarity: if you have a strong reference to *default_value* before "

"both *default_value* and *\\*result* (if it's not ``NULL``). These may refer "
"to the same object: in that case you hold two separate references to it."

"Iterate over all key-value pairs in the dictionary *p*.  The :c:type:"
"`Py_ssize_t` referred to by *ppos* must be initialized to ``0`` prior to the "
"first call to this function to start the iteration; the function returns "
"true for each pair in the dictionary, and false once all pairs have been "

"`PyObject*` variables that will be filled in with each key and value, "
"respectively, or may be ``NULL``.  Any references returned through them are "
"borrowed.  *ppos* should not be altered during iteration. Its value "
