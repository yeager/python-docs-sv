"Return a dictionary of the builtins in the current execution frame, or the "
"interpreter of the thread state if no frame is currently executing."

"Use either :c:func:`PyEval_GetFrameLocals` to obtain the same behaviour as "
"calling :func:`locals` in Python code, or else call :c:func:"
"`PyFrame_GetLocals` on the result of :c:func:`PyEval_GetFrame` to access "
"the :attr:`~frame.f_locals` attribute of the currently executing frame."

"Return a mapping providing access to the local variables in the current "

msgid ""
"As this function returns a :term:`borrowed reference`, the dictionary "
"returned for :term:`optimized scopes <optimized scope>` is cached on the "
"frame object and will remain alive as long as the frame object does. Unlike :"
"c:func:`PyEval_GetFrameLocals` and :func:`locals`, subsequent calls to this "
"function in the same frame will update the contents of the cached dictionary "
"to reflect changes in the state of the local variables rather than returning "
"a new snapshot."

"As part of :pep:`667`, :c:func:`PyFrame_GetLocals`, :func:`locals`, and :"
"attr:`FrameType.f_locals <frame.f_locals>` no longer make use of the shared "
"cache dictionary. Refer to the :ref:`What's New entry <whatsnew313-locals-"
"semantics>` for additional details."
