msgid ":mod:`!wave` --- Read and write WAV files"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/wave.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`wave` module provides a convenient interface to the Waveform Audio "
"\"WAVE\" (or \"WAV\") file format. Only uncompressed PCM encoded wave files "
"are supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for ``WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE`` headers was added, provided that the "
"extended format is ``KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_PCM``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`wave` module defines the following function and exception:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *file* is a string, open the file by that name, otherwise treat it as a "
"file-like object.  *mode* can be:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``'rb'``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Read only mode."
msgstr ""

msgid "``'wb'``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Write only mode."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that it does not allow read/write WAV files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *mode* of ``'rb'`` returns a :class:`Wave_read` object, while a *mode* of "
"``'wb'`` returns a :class:`Wave_write` object.  If *mode* is omitted and a "
"file-like object is passed as *file*, ``file.mode`` is used as the default "
"value for *mode*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you pass in a file-like object, the wave object will not close it when "
"its ``close()`` method is called; it is the caller's responsibility to close "
"the file object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`.open` function may be used in a :keyword:`with` statement.  When "
"the :keyword:`!with` block completes, the :meth:`Wave_read.close` or :meth:"
"`Wave_write.close` method is called."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for unseekable files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An error raised when something is impossible because it violates the WAV "
"specification or hits an implementation deficiency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wave_read Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "Read a WAV file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wave_read objects, as returned by :func:`.open`, have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Close the stream if it was opened by :mod:`wave`, and make the instance "
"unusable.  This is called automatically on object collection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns number of audio channels (``1`` for mono, ``2`` for stereo)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns sample width in bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns sampling frequency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns number of audio frames."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns compression type (``'NONE'`` is the only supported type)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Human-readable version of :meth:`getcomptype`. Usually ``'not compressed'`` "
"parallels ``'NONE'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a :func:`~collections.namedtuple` ``(nchannels, sampwidth, "
"framerate, nframes, comptype, compname)``, equivalent to output of the "
"``get*()`` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reads and returns at most *n* frames of audio, as a :class:`bytes` object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rewind the file pointer to the beginning of the audio stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following two methods are defined for compatibility with the old :mod:`!"
"aifc` module, and don't do anything interesting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The method only existed for compatibility with the :mod:`!aifc` module which "
"has been removed in Python 3.13."
msgstr ""

msgid "Raise an error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following two methods define a term \"position\" which is compatible "
"between them, and is otherwise implementation dependent."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the file pointer to the specified position."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return current file pointer position."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wave_write Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "Write a WAV file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wave_write objects, as returned by :func:`.open`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For seekable output streams, the ``wave`` header will automatically be "
"updated to reflect the number of frames actually written.  For unseekable "
"streams, the *nframes* value must be accurate when the first frame data is "
"written.  An accurate *nframes* value can be achieved either by calling :"
"meth:`setnframes` or :meth:`setparams` with the number of frames that will "
"be written before :meth:`close` is called and then using :meth:"
"`writeframesraw` to write the frame data, or by calling :meth:`writeframes` "
"with all of the frame data to be written.  In the latter case :meth:"
"`writeframes` will calculate the number of frames in the data and set "
"*nframes* accordingly before writing the frame data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wave_write objects have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure *nframes* is correct, and close the file if it was opened by :mod:"
"`wave`.  This method is called upon object collection.  It will raise an "
"exception if the output stream is not seekable and *nframes* does not match "
"the number of frames actually written."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the number of channels."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the sample width to *n* bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the frame rate to *n*."
msgstr ""

msgid "A non-integral input to this method is rounded to the nearest integer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the number of frames to *n*.  This will be changed later if the number "
"of frames actually written is different (this update attempt will raise an "
"error if the output stream is not seekable)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the compression type and description. At the moment, only compression "
"type ``NONE`` is supported, meaning no compression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *tuple* should be ``(nchannels, sampwidth, framerate, nframes, comptype, "
"compname)``, with values valid for the ``set*()`` methods.  Sets all "
"parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return current position in the file, with the same disclaimer for the :meth:"
"`Wave_read.tell` and :meth:`Wave_read.setpos` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "Write audio frames, without correcting *nframes*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Any :term:`bytes-like object` is now accepted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Write audio frames and make sure *nframes* is correct.  It will raise an "
"error if the output stream is not seekable and the total number of frames "
"that have been written after *data* has been written does not match the "
"previously set value for *nframes*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that it is invalid to set any parameters after calling :meth:"
"`writeframes` or :meth:`writeframesraw`, and any attempt to do so will "
"raise :exc:`wave.Error`."
