msgid "Supporting Cyclic Garbage Collection"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python's support for detecting and collecting garbage which involves "
"circular references requires support from object types which are "
"\"containers\" for other objects which may also be containers.  Types which "
"do not store references to other objects, or which only store references to "
"atomic types (such as numbers or strings), do not need to provide any "
"explicit support for garbage collection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a container type, the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_flags` field of "
"the type object must include the :c:macro:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC` and provide "
"an implementation of the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` handler.  If "
"instances of the type are mutable, a :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_clear` "
"implementation must also be provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ":c:macro:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC`"

msgid ""
"Objects with a type with this flag set must conform with the rules "
"documented here.  For convenience these objects will be referred to as "
"container objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Constructors for container types must conform to two rules:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The memory for the object must be allocated using :c:macro:`PyObject_GC_New` "
"or :c:macro:`PyObject_GC_NewVar`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once all the fields which may contain references to other containers are "
"initialized, it must call :c:func:`PyObject_GC_Track`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, the deallocator for the object must conform to a similar pair of "
"rules:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before fields which refer to other containers are invalidated, :c:func:"
"`PyObject_GC_UnTrack` must be called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object's memory must be deallocated using :c:func:`PyObject_GC_Del`."

msgid ""
"When calling :c:func:`PyType_Ready` or some of the APIs that indirectly call "
