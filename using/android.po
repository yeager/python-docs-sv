msgid "Using Python on Android"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python on Android is unlike Python on desktop platforms. On a desktop "
"platform, Python is generally installed as a system resource that can be "
"used by any user of that computer. Users then interact with Python by "
"running a :program:`python` executable and entering commands at an "
"interactive prompt, or by running a Python script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Android, there is no concept of installing as a system resource. The only "
"unit of software distribution is an \"app\". There is also no console where "
"you could run a :program:`python` executable, or interact with a Python REPL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, the only way you can use Python on Android is in embedded mode "
"â€“ that is, by writing a native Android application, embedding a Python "
"interpreter using ``libpython``, and invoking Python code using the :ref:"
"`Python embedding API <embedding>`. The full Python interpreter, the "
"standard library, and all your Python code is then packaged into your app "
"for its own private use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Python standard library has some notable omissions and restrictions on "
"Android. See the :ref:`API availability guide <mobile-availability>` for "
"details."
