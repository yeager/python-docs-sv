"This module provides :term:`abstract base classes <abstract base class>` "
"that can be used to test whether a class provides a particular interface; "
"for example, whether it is :term:`hashable` or whether it is a :term:"
"`mapping`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An :func:`issubclass` or :func:`isinstance` test for an interface works in "
"one of three ways."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A newly written class can inherit directly from one of the abstract base "
"classes.  The class must supply the required abstract methods.  The "
"remaining mixin methods come from inheritance and can be overridden if "
"desired.  Other methods may be added as needed:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"class C(Sequence):                      # Direct inheritance\n"
"    def __init__(self): ...             # Extra method not required by the "
"ABC\n"
"    def __getitem__(self, index):  ...  # Required abstract method\n"

"True"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Existing classes and built-in classes can be registered as \"virtual "
"subclasses\" of the ABCs.  Those classes should define the full API "
"including all of the abstract methods and all of the mixin methods. This "
"lets users rely on :func:`issubclass` or :func:`isinstance` tests to "
"determine whether the full interface is supported.  The exception to this "
"rule is for methods that are automatically inferred from the rest of the API:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"class D:                                 # No inheritance\n"

">>> issubclass(D, Sequence)\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, class :class:`!D` does not need to define ``__contains__``, "
"``__iter__``, and ``__reversed__`` because the :ref:`in-operator "
"<comparisons>`, the :term:`iteration <iterable>` logic, and the :func:"
"`reversed` function automatically fall back to using ``__getitem__`` and "
"``__len__``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some simple interfaces are directly recognizable by the presence of the "
"required methods (unless those methods have been set to :const:`None`):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"class E:\n"
"    def __iter__(self): ...\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> issubclass(E, Iterable)\n"
"True\n"
">>> isinstance(E(), Iterable)\n"
"True"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Complex interfaces do not support this last technique because an interface "
"is more than just the presence of method names.  Interfaces specify "
"semantics and relationships between methods that cannot be inferred solely "
"from the presence of specific method names.  For example, knowing that a "
"class supplies ``__getitem__``, ``__len__``, and ``__iter__`` is "
"insufficient for distinguishing a :class:`Sequence` from a :class:`Mapping`."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since some set operations create new sets, the default mixin methods need a "
"way to create new instances from an :term:`iterable`. The class constructor "
"is assumed to have a signature in the form ``ClassName(iterable)``. That "
"assumption is factored-out to an internal :class:`classmethod` called :meth:"
"`!_from_iterable` which calls ``cls(iterable)`` to produce a new set. If "
"the :class:`Set` mixin is being used in a class with a different constructor "
"signature, you will need to override :meth:`!_from_iterable` with a "
"classmethod or regular method that can construct new instances from an "
"iterable argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To override the comparisons (presumably for speed, as the semantics are "
"fixed), redefine :meth:`~object.__le__` and :meth:`~object.__ge__`, then the "
"other operations will automatically follow suit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`Set` mixin provides a :meth:`!_hash` method to compute a hash "
"value for the set; however, :meth:`~object.__hash__` is not defined because "
"not all sets are :term:`hashable` or immutable.  To add set hashability "
"using mixins, inherit from both :meth:`Set` and :meth:`Hashable`, then "
"define ``__hash__ = Set._hash``."
