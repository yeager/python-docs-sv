msgid "Support for Perf Maps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On supported platforms (as of this writing, only Linux), the runtime can "
"take advantage of *perf map files* to make Python functions visible to an "
"external profiling tool (such as `perf <https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index."
"php/Main_Page>`_). A running process may create a file in the ``/tmp`` "
"directory, which contains entries that can map a section of executable code "
"to a name. This interface is described in the `documentation of the Linux "
"Perf tool <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/ kernel/git/torvalds/linux."
"git/tree/tools/perf/Documentation/jit-interface.txt>`_."

msgid ""
"In Python, these helper APIs can be used by libraries and features that rely "
"on generating machine code on the fly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that holding an :term:`attached thread state` is not required for these "
"APIs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open the ``/tmp/perf-$pid.map`` file, unless it's already opened, and create "
"a lock to ensure thread-safe writes to the file (provided the writes are "
"done through :c:func:`PyUnstable_WritePerfMapEntry`). Normally, there's no "
"need to call this explicitly; just use :c:func:"
"`PyUnstable_WritePerfMapEntry` and it will initialize the state on first "
"call."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns ``0`` on success, ``-1`` on failure to create/open the perf map "
"file, or ``-2`` on failure to create a lock. Check ``errno`` for more "
"information about the cause of a failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Write one single entry to the ``/tmp/perf-$pid.map`` file. This function is "
"thread safe. Here is what an example entry looks like::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"# address      size  name\n"
"7f3529fcf759 b     py::bar:/run/t.py"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Will call :c:func:`PyUnstable_PerfMapState_Init` before writing the entry, "
"if the perf map file is not already opened. Returns ``0`` on success, or the "
"same error codes as :c:func:`PyUnstable_PerfMapState_Init` on failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Close the perf map file opened by :c:func:`PyUnstable_PerfMapState_Init`. "
"This is called by the runtime itself during interpreter shut-down. In "
"general, there shouldn't be a reason to explicitly call this, except to "
"handle specific scenarios such as forking."
