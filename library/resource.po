msgid ":mod:`!resource` --- Resource usage information"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides basic mechanisms for measuring and controlling system "
"resources utilized by a program."
msgstr ""

msgid "Availability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Symbolic constants are used to specify particular system resources and to "
"request usage information about either the current process or its children."
msgstr ""

msgid "An :exc:`OSError` is raised on syscall failure."
msgstr ""

msgid "A deprecated alias of :exc:`OSError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Following :pep:`3151`, this class was made an alias of :exc:`OSError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Resource Limits"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Resources usage can be limited using the :func:`setrlimit` function "
"described below. Each resource is controlled by a pair of limits: a soft "
"limit and a hard limit. The soft limit is the current limit, and may be "
"lowered or raised by a process over time. The soft limit can never exceed "
"the hard limit. The hard limit can be lowered to any value greater than the "
"soft limit, but not raised. (Only processes with the effective UID of the "
"super-user can raise a hard limit.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The specific resources that can be limited are system dependent. They are "
"described in the :manpage:`getrlimit(2)` man page.  The resources listed "
"below are supported when the underlying operating system supports them; "
"resources which cannot be checked or controlled by the operating system are "
"not defined in this module for those platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "Constant used to represent the limit for an unlimited resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a tuple ``(soft, hard)`` with the current soft and hard limits of "
"*resource*. Raises :exc:`ValueError` if an invalid resource is specified, "
"or :exc:`error` if the underlying system call fails unexpectedly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sets new limits of consumption of *resource*. The *limits* argument must be "
"a tuple ``(soft, hard)`` of two integers describing the new limits. A value "
"of :data:`~resource.RLIM_INFINITY` can be used to request a limit that is "
"unlimited."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`ValueError` if an invalid resource is specified, if the new "
"soft limit exceeds the hard limit, or if a process tries to raise its hard "
"limit. Specifying a limit of :data:`~resource.RLIM_INFINITY` when the hard "
"or system limit for that resource is not unlimited will result in a :exc:"
"`ValueError`.  A process with the effective UID of super-user can request "
"any valid limit value, including unlimited, but :exc:`ValueError` will still "
"be raised if the requested limit exceeds the system imposed limit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``setrlimit`` may also raise :exc:`error` if the underlying system call "
"fails."
msgstr ""

msgid "VxWorks only supports setting :data:`RLIMIT_NOFILE`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``resource.setrlimit`` with "
"arguments ``resource``, ``limits``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Combines :func:`setrlimit` and :func:`getrlimit` in one function and "
"supports to get and set the resources limits of an arbitrary process. If "
"*pid* is 0, then the call applies to the current process. *resource* and "
"*limits* have the same meaning as in :func:`setrlimit`, except that *limits* "
"is optional."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When *limits* is not given the function returns the *resource* limit of the "
"process *pid*. When *limits* is given the *resource* limit of the process is "
"set and the former resource limit is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`ProcessLookupError` when *pid* can't be found and :exc:"
"`PermissionError` when the user doesn't have ``CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`` for the "
"process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``resource.prlimit`` with "
"arguments ``pid``, ``resource``, ``limits``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These symbols define resources whose consumption can be controlled using "
"the :func:`setrlimit` and :func:`getrlimit` functions described below. The "
"values of these symbols are exactly the constants used by C programs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Unix man page for :manpage:`getrlimit(2)` lists the available resources. "
"Note that not all systems use the same symbol or same value to denote the "
"same resource.  This module does not attempt to mask platform differences "
"--- symbols not defined for a platform will not be available from this "
"module on that platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The maximum size (in bytes) of a core file that the current process can "
"create. This may result in the creation of a partial core file if a larger "
"core would be required to contain the entire process image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The maximum amount of processor time (in seconds) that a process can use. If "
"this limit is exceeded, a :const:`SIGXCPU` signal is sent to the process. "
"(See the :mod:`signal` module documentation for information about how to "
"catch this signal and do something useful, e.g. flush open files to disk.)"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "The maximum size (in bytes) of the process's heap."

msgid "The ceiling of the real-time priority."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The time limit (in microseconds) on CPU time that a process can spend under "
"real-time scheduling without making a blocking syscall."
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of signals which the process may queue."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The maximum size (in bytes) of socket buffer usage for this user. This "
"limits the amount of network memory, and hence the amount of mbufs, that "
"this user may hold at any time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The maximum size (in bytes) of the swap space that may be reserved or used "
"by all of this user id's processes. This limit is enforced only if bit 1 of "
"the vm.overcommit sysctl is set. Please see `tuning(7) <https://man.freebsd."
"org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tuning&sektion=7>`__ for a complete description of "

msgid ""
"The fields of the return value each describe how a particular system "
"resource has been used, e.g. amount of time spent running is user mode or "
"number of times the process was swapped out of main memory. Some values are "
"dependent on the clock tick internal, e.g. the amount of memory the process "
