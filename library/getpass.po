msgid ":mod:`!getpass` --- Portable password input"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/getpass.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Availability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly. See :ref:`wasm-"
"availability` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`getpass` module provides two functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prompt the user for a password without echoing.  The user is prompted using "
"the string *prompt*, which defaults to ``'Password: '``.  On Unix, the "
"prompt is written to the file-like object *stream* using the replace error "
"handler if needed.  *stream* defaults to the controlling terminal (:file:`/"
"dev/tty`) or if that is unavailable to ``sys.stderr`` (this argument is "
"ignored on Windows)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *echo_char* argument controls how user input is displayed while typing. "
"If *echo_char* is ``None`` (default), input remains hidden. Otherwise, "
"*echo_char* must be a printable ASCII string and each typed character is "
"replaced by it. For example, ``echo_char='*'`` will display asterisks "
"instead of the actual input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If echo free input is unavailable getpass() falls back to printing a warning "
"message to *stream* and reading from ``sys.stdin`` and issuing a :exc:"
"`GetPassWarning`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you call getpass from within IDLE, the input may be done in the terminal "
"you launched IDLE from rather than the idle window itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *echo_char* parameter for keyboard feedback."
msgstr ""

msgid "A :exc:`UserWarning` subclass issued when password input may be echoed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the \"login name\" of the user."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function checks the environment variables :envvar:`LOGNAME`, :envvar:"
"`USER`, :envvar:`!LNAME` and :envvar:`USERNAME`, in order, and returns the "
"value of the first one which is set to a non-empty string.  If none are set, "
"the login name from the password database is returned on systems which "
"support the :mod:`pwd` module, otherwise, an :exc:`OSError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid "In general, this function should be preferred over :func:`os.getlogin`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Previously, various exceptions beyond just :exc:`OSError` were raised."
