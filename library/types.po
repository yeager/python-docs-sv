msgid ":mod:`!types` --- Dynamic type creation and names for built-in types"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/types.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module defines utility functions to assist in dynamic creation of new "
"types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It also defines names for some object types that are used by the standard "
"Python interpreter, but not exposed as builtins like :class:`int` or :class:"
"`str` are."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, it provides some additional type-related utility classes and "
"functions that are not fundamental enough to be builtins."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dynamic Type Creation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Creates a class object dynamically using the appropriate metaclass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first three arguments are the components that make up a class definition "
"header: the class name, the base classes (in order), the keyword arguments "
"(such as ``metaclass``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *exec_body* argument is a callback that is used to populate the freshly "
"created class namespace. It should accept the class namespace as its sole "
"argument and update the namespace directly with the class contents. If no "
"callback is provided, it has the same effect as passing in ``lambda ns: "
"None``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Calculates the appropriate metaclass and creates the class namespace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The arguments are the components that make up a class definition header: the "
"class name, the base classes (in order) and the keyword arguments (such as "
"``metaclass``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The return value is a 3-tuple: ``metaclass, namespace, kwds``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*metaclass* is the appropriate metaclass, *namespace* is the prepared class "
"namespace and *kwds* is an updated copy of the passed in *kwds* argument "
"with any ``'metaclass'`` entry removed. If no *kwds* argument is passed in, "
"this will be an empty dict."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default value for the ``namespace`` element of the returned tuple has "

msgid "Resolve MRO entries dynamically as specified by :pep:`560`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function looks for items in *bases* that are not instances of :class:"
"`type`, and returns a tuple where each such object that has an :meth:"
"`~object.__mro_entries__` method is replaced with an unpacked result of "
"calling this method.  If a *bases* item is an instance of :class:`type`, or "

":py:class:`SimpleNamespace` objects may be initialized in the same way as :"

"``SimpleNamespace`` may be useful as a replacement for ``class NS: pass``. "

":class:`!SimpleNamespace` objects are supported by :func:`copy.replace`."

msgid "Route attribute access on a class to __getattr__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a descriptor, used to define attributes that act differently when "

"normal, but access to an attribute through a class will be routed to the "
