"In traditional Unix the field ``pw_passwd`` usually contains a password "
"encrypted with a DES derived algorithm.  However most modern unices  use a "
"so-called *shadow password* system.  On those unices the *pw_passwd* field "
"only contains an asterisk (``'*'``) or the  letter ``'x'`` where the "
"encrypted password is stored in a file :file:`/etc/shadow` which is not "
"world readable.  Whether the *pw_passwd* field contains anything useful is "
"system-dependent."
