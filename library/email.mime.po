msgid ":mod:`!email.mime`: Creating email and MIME objects from scratch"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/email/mime/`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module is part of the legacy (``Compat32``) email API.  Its "
"functionality is partially replaced by the :mod:`~email.contentmanager` in "
"the new API, but in certain applications these classes may still be useful, "
"even in non-legacy code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ordinarily, you get a message object structure by passing a file or some "
"text to a parser, which parses the text and returns the root message "
"object.  However you can also build a complete message structure from "
"scratch, or even individual :class:`~email.message.Message` objects by "
"hand.  In fact, you can also take an existing structure and add new :class:"
"`~email.message.Message` objects, move them around, etc.  This makes a very "
"convenient interface for slicing-and-dicing MIME messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create a new object structure by creating :class:`~email.message."
"Message` instances, adding attachments and all the appropriate headers "
"manually.  For MIME messages though, the :mod:`email` package provides some "
"convenient subclasses to make things easier."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are the classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Module: :mod:`email.mime.base`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the base class for all the MIME-specific subclasses of :class:"
"`~email.message.Message`.  Ordinarily you won't create instances "
"specifically of :class:`MIMEBase`, although you could.  :class:`MIMEBase` is "
"provided primarily as a convenient base class for more specific MIME-aware "
"subclasses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*_maintype* is the :mailheader:`Content-Type` major type (e.g. :mimetype:"
"`text` or :mimetype:`image`), and *_subtype* is the :mailheader:`Content-"
"Type` minor type  (e.g. :mimetype:`plain` or :mimetype:`gif`).  *_params* is "
"a parameter key/value dictionary and is passed directly to :meth:`Message."
"add_header <email.message.Message.add_header>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *policy* is specified, (defaults to the :class:`compat32 <email.policy."
"Compat32>` policy) it will be passed to :class:`~email.message.Message`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`MIMEBase` class always adds a :mailheader:`Content-Type` header "
