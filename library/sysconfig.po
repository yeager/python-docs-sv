":mod:`!sysconfig` --- Provide access to Python's configuration information"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/sysconfig`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`sysconfig` module provides access to Python's configuration "
"information like the list of installation paths and the configuration "
"variables relevant for the current platform."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Python distribution contains a :file:`Makefile` and a :file:`pyconfig.h` "
"header file that are necessary to build both the Python binary itself and "
"third-party C extensions compiled using ``setuptools``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":mod:`sysconfig` puts all variables found in these files in a dictionary "
"that can be accessed using :func:`get_config_vars` or :func:`get_config_var`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Notice that on Windows, it's a much smaller set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With no arguments, return a dictionary of all configuration variables "
"relevant for the current platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With arguments, return a list of values that result from looking up each "
"argument in the configuration variable dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid "For each argument, if the value is not found, return ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the value of a single variable *name*. Equivalent to "
"``get_config_vars().get(name)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "If *name* is not found, return ``None``."

msgid "Installation paths"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python uses an installation scheme that differs depending on the platform "
"and on the installation options.  These schemes are stored in :mod:"
"`sysconfig` under unique identifiers based on the value returned by :const:"
"`os.name`. The schemes are used by package installers to determine where to "
"copy files to."
msgstr ""

msgid "Python currently supports nine schemes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*posix_prefix*: scheme for POSIX platforms like Linux or macOS.  This is the "
"default scheme used when Python or a component is installed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*posix_home*: scheme for POSIX platforms, when the *home* option is used. "
"This scheme defines paths located under a specific home prefix."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*posix_user*: scheme for POSIX platforms, when the *user* option is used. "
"This scheme defines paths located under the user's home directory (:const:"
"`site.USER_BASE`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*posix_venv*: scheme for :mod:`Python virtual environments <venv>` on POSIX "
"platforms; by default it is the same as *posix_prefix*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*nt*: scheme for Windows. This is the default scheme used when Python or a "
"component is installed."
msgstr ""

msgid "*nt_user*: scheme for Windows, when the *user* option is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*nt_venv*: scheme for :mod:`Python virtual environments <venv>` on Windows; "
"by default it is the same as *nt*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*venv*: a scheme with values from either *posix_venv* or *nt_venv* depending "
"on the platform Python runs on."
msgstr ""

msgid "*osx_framework_user*: scheme for macOS, when the *user* option is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each scheme is itself composed of a series of paths and each path has a "
"unique identifier.  Python currently uses eight paths:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*stdlib*: directory containing the standard Python library files that are "
"not platform-specific."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*platstdlib*: directory containing the standard Python library files that "
"are platform-specific."
msgstr ""

"*include*: directory for non-platform-specific header files for the Python C-"
"API."

"API."
msgstr ""

msgid "*scripts*: directory for script files."
msgstr ""

msgid "*data*: directory for data files."

msgid "User scheme"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This scheme is designed to be the most convenient solution for users that "
"don't have write permission to the global site-packages directory or don't "
"want to install into it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Files will be installed into subdirectories of :const:`site.USER_BASE` "

msgid "Home scheme"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The idea behind the \"home scheme\" is that you build and maintain a "
"personal stash of Python modules.  This scheme's name is derived from the "
"idea of a \"home\" directory on Unix, since it's not unusual for a Unix user "
"to make their home directory have a layout similar to :file:`/usr/` or :file:"
"`/usr/local/`. This scheme can be used by anyone, regardless of the "
"operating system they are installing for."

msgid "Prefix scheme"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"prefix scheme\" is useful when you wish to use one Python installation "
"to perform the build/install (i.e., to run the setup script), but install "
"modules into the third-party module directory of a different Python "
"installation (or something that looks like a different Python "
"installation).  If this sounds a trifle unusual, it is---that's why the user "
"and home schemes come before.  However, there are at least two known cases "
"where the prefix scheme will be useful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, consider that many Linux distributions put Python in :file:`/usr`, "
"rather than the more traditional :file:`/usr/local`.  This is entirely "
"appropriate, since in those cases Python is part of \"the system\" rather "
"than a local add-on. However, if you are installing Python modules from "
"source, you probably want them to go in :file:`/usr/local/lib/python2.{X}` "
"rather than :file:`/usr/lib/python2.{X}`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another possibility is a network filesystem where the name used to write to "
"a remote directory is different from the name used to read it: for example, "
"the Python interpreter accessed as :file:`/usr/local/bin/python` might "
"search for modules in :file:`/usr/local/lib/python2.{X}`, but those modules "
"would have to be installed to, say, :file:`/mnt/{@server}/export/lib/python2."
"{X}`."

"Return a tuple containing all schemes currently supported in :mod:"

msgid "Return the default scheme name for the current platform."

"Return a preferred scheme name for an installation layout specified by *key*."

msgid "*key* must be either ``\"prefix\"``, ``\"home\"``, or ``\"user\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The return value is a scheme name listed in :func:`get_scheme_names`. It can "
"be passed to :mod:`sysconfig` functions that take a *scheme* argument, such "
"as :func:`get_paths`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When Python runs from a virtual environment and ``key=\"prefix\"``, the "
"*venv* scheme is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a dict containing preferred scheme names on the current platform. "
"Python implementers and redistributors may add their preferred schemes to "
"the ``_INSTALL_SCHEMES`` module-level global value, and modify this function "
"to return those scheme names, to e.g. provide different schemes for system "
"and language package managers to use, so packages installed by either do not "
"mix with those by the other."

"End users should not use this function, but :func:`get_default_scheme` and :"

"*name* has to be a value from the list returned by :func:`get_path_names`."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`get_path` will use the variables returned by :func:`get_config_vars` "

"one may call this function and get the default value."
