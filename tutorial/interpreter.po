msgid "Invoking the Interpreter"

msgid ""
"The Python interpreter is usually installed as |"
"usr_local_bin_python_x_dot_y_literal| on those machines where it is "
"available; putting :file:`/usr/local/bin` in your Unix shell's search path "
"makes it possible to start it by typing the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "python3.14"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"to the shell. [#]_ Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter "
"lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your "
"local Python guru or system administrator.  (E.g., :file:`/usr/local/python` "
"is a popular alternative location.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the :ref:`Microsoft "
"Store <windows-store>`, the |python_x_dot_y_literal| command will be "
"available. If you have the :ref:`py.exe launcher <launcher>` installed, you "
"can use the :file:`py` command. See :ref:`setting-envvars` for other ways to "
"launch Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Typing an end-of-file character (:kbd:`Control-D` on Unix, :kbd:`Control-Z` "
"on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero "
"exit status.  If that doesn't work, you can exit the interpreter by typing "
"the following command: ``quit()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The interpreter's line-editing features include interactive editing, history "
"substitution and code completion on systems that support the `GNU Readline "
"<https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html>`_ library. Perhaps "
"the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is "
"typing :kbd:`Control-P` to the first Python prompt you get.  If it beeps, "
"you have command line editing; see Appendix :ref:`tut-interacting` for an "
"introduction to the keys.  If nothing appears to happen, or if ``^P`` is "
"echoed, command line editing isn't available; you'll only be able to use "
"backspace to remove characters from the current line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with "
"standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands "
"interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as "
"standard input, it reads and executes a *script* from that file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A second way of starting the interpreter is ``python -c command [arg] ...``, "
"which executes the statement(s) in *command*, analogous to the shell's :"
"option:`-c` option.  Since Python statements often contain spaces or other "
"characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote "
"*command* in its entirety."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some Python modules are also useful as scripts.  These can be invoked using "
"``python -m module [arg] ...``, which executes the source file for *module* "
"as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the "
"script and enter interactive mode afterwards.  This can be done by passing :"
"option:`-i` before the script."
msgstr ""

msgid "All command line options are described in :ref:`using-on-general`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Argument Passing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments "
"thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the ``argv`` "
"variable in the ``sys`` module.  You can access this list by executing "
"``import sys``.  The length of the list is at least one; when no script and "
"no arguments are given, ``sys.argv[0]`` is an empty string.  When the script "
"name is given as ``'-'`` (meaning  standard input), ``sys.argv[0]`` is set "
"to ``'-'``.  When :option:`-c` *command* is used, ``sys.argv[0]`` is set to "
"``'-c'``.  When :option:`-m` *module* is used, ``sys.argv[0]``  is set to "
"the full name of the located module.  Options found after  :option:`-c` "
"*command* or :option:`-m` *module* are not consumed  by the Python "
"interpreter's option processing but left in ``sys.argv`` for  the command or "
"module to handle."
msgstr ""

msgid "Interactive Mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in "
"*interactive mode*.  In this mode it prompts for the next command with the "
"*primary prompt*, usually three greater-than signs (``>>>``); for "
"continuation lines it prompts with the *secondary prompt*, by default three "
"dots (``...``). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version "
"number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:"

msgid "Source Code Encoding"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.  In that "
"encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used "
"simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments --- although the "
"standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention "
"that any portable code should follow.  To display all these characters "
"properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use "
"a font that supports all the characters in the file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line "
"should be added as the *first* line of the file.  The syntax is as follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid "# -*- coding: encoding -*-"
msgstr ""

msgid "where *encoding* is one of the valid :mod:`codecs` supported by Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first "
"line of your source code file should be::"
msgstr ""

msgid "# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One exception to the *first line* rule is when the source code starts with "
"a :ref:`UNIX \"shebang\" line <tut-scripts>`.  In this case, the encoding "
"declaration should be added as the second line of the file.  For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"#!/usr/bin/env python3\n"
"# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-"

"On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the "
"executable named ``python``, so that it does not conflict with a "
"simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable."
