msgid ":mod:`!stat` --- Interpreting :func:`~os.stat` results"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/stat.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`stat` module defines constants and functions for interpreting the "
"results of :func:`os.stat`, :func:`os.fstat` and :func:`os.lstat` (if they "
"exist).  For complete details about the :c:func:`stat`, :c:func:`!fstat` "
"and :c:func:`!lstat` calls, consult the documentation for your system."
msgstr ""

msgid "The stat module is backed by a C implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`stat` module defines the following functions to test for specific "
"file types:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a character special device file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a block special device file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a regular file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a FIFO (named pipe)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a symbolic link."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a socket."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a door."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from an event port."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a whiteout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two additional functions are defined for more general manipulation of the "
"file's mode:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the portion of the file's mode that can be set by :func:`os.chmod`\\ "
"---that is, the file's permission bits, plus the sticky bit, set-group-id, "
"and set-user-id bits (on systems that support them)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the portion of the file's mode that describes the file type (used by "
"the :func:`!S_IS\\*` functions above)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, you would use the :func:`!os.path.is\\*` functions for testing the "
"type of a file; the functions here are useful when you are doing multiple "
"tests of the same file and wish to avoid the overhead of the :c:func:`stat` "
"system call for each test.  These are also useful when checking for "
"information about a file that isn't handled by :mod:`os.path`, like the "
"tests for block and character devices."

"Unix) is the time of the last metadata change, and, on others (like "
"Windows), is the creation time (see platform documentation for details)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The interpretation of \"file size\" changes according to the file type.  For "
"plain files this is the size of the file in bytes.  For FIFOs and sockets "
"under most flavors of Unix (including Linux in particular), the \"size\" is "
"the number of bytes waiting to be read at the time of the call to :func:`os."
"stat`, :func:`os.fstat`, or :func:`os.lstat`; this can sometimes be useful, "
"especially for polling one of these special files after a non-blocking "
"open.  The meaning of the size field for other character and block devices "
"varies more, depending on the implementation of the underlying system call."
