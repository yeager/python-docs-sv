msgid "Weak Reference Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python supports *weak references* as first-class objects.  There are two "
"specific object types which directly implement weak references.  The first "
"is a simple reference object, and the second acts as a proxy for the "
"original object as much as it can."

msgid ""
"Return non-zero if *ob* is either a reference or proxy object.  This "
"function always succeeds."

msgid ""
"Return a weak reference object for the object *ob*.  This will always return "
"a new reference, but is not guaranteed to create a new object; an existing "
"reference object may be returned.  The second parameter, *callback*, can be "
"a callable object that receives notification when *ob* is garbage collected; "
"it should accept a single parameter, which will be the weak reference object "
"itself. *callback* may also be ``None`` or ``NULL``.  If *ob* is not a "
"weakly referenceable object, or if *callback* is not callable, ``None``, or "
"``NULL``, this will return ``NULL`` and raise :exc:`TypeError`."

"Return a weak reference proxy object for the object *ob*.  This will always "
"return a new reference, but is not guaranteed to create a new object; an "
"existing proxy object may be returned.  The second parameter, *callback*, "
"can be a callable object that receives notification when *ob* is garbage "
"collected; it should accept a single parameter, which will be the weak "
"reference object itself. *callback* may also be ``None`` or ``NULL``.  If "
"*ob* is not a weakly referenceable object, or if *callback* is not callable, "
"``None``, or ``NULL``, this will return ``NULL`` and raise :exc:`TypeError`."

"Get a :term:`strong reference` to the referenced object from a weak "
"reference, *ref*, into *\\*pobj*."
msgstr ""
"Hämta en :term:`strong reference` till det refererade objektet från en svag "
"referens, *ref*, till *\\*pobj*."

msgid ""
"On success, set *\\*pobj* to a new :term:`strong reference` to the "
"referenced object and return 1."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the reference is dead, set *\\*pobj* to ``NULL`` and return 0."

msgid "On error, raise an exception and return -1."

msgid ""
"Return a :term:`borrowed reference` to the referenced object from a weak "
"reference, *ref*.  If the referent is no longer live, returns ``Py_None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function returns a :term:`borrowed reference` to the referenced object. "
"This means that you should always call :c:func:`Py_INCREF` on the object "
"except when it cannot be destroyed before the last usage of the borrowed "
"reference."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use :c:func:`PyWeakref_GetRef` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to :c:func:`PyWeakref_GetObject`, but does no error checking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test if the weak reference *ref* is dead. Returns 1 if the reference is "
"dead, 0 if it is alive, and -1 with an error set if *ref* is not a weak "
"reference object."

"This function is called by the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc` handler "
"to clear weak references."
msgstr ""
"Denna funktion anropas av hanteraren :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc` "
"för att rensa svaga referenser."

msgid ""
"This iterates through the weak references for *object* and calls callbacks "
"for those references which have one. It returns when all callbacks have been "
"attempted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clears the weakrefs for *object* without calling the callbacks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is called by the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc` handler "
"for types with finalizers (i.e., :meth:`~object.__del__`).  The handler for "
"those objects first calls :c:func:`PyObject_ClearWeakRefs` to clear weakrefs "
"and call their callbacks, then the finalizer, and finally this function to "
"clear any weakrefs that may have been created by the finalizer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most circumstances, it's more appropriate to use :c:func:"
"`PyObject_ClearWeakRefs` to clear weakrefs instead of this function."
