"The following exception classes are defined in the :mod:`email.errors` "
"module:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the base class for all exceptions that the :mod:`email` package can "
"raise.  It is derived from the standard :exc:`Exception` class and defines "
"no additional methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the base class for exceptions raised by the :class:`~email.parser."
"Parser` class.  It is derived from :exc:`MessageError`.  This class is also "
"used internally by the parser used by :mod:`~email.headerregistry`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raised under some error conditions when parsing the :rfc:`5322` headers of a "
"message, this class is derived from :exc:`MessageParseError`.  The :meth:"
"`~email.message.EmailMessage.set_boundary` method will raise this error if "
"the content type is unknown when the method is called. :class:`~email.header."
"Header` may raise this error for certain base64 decoding errors, and when an "
"attempt is made to create a header that appears to contain an embedded "
"header (that is, there is what is supposed to be a continuation line that "
"has no leading whitespace and looks like a header)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deprecated and no longer used."

msgid ""
"Raised if the :meth:`~email.message.Message.attach` method is called on an "
"instance of a class derived from :class:`~email.mime.nonmultipart."
"MIMENonMultipart` (e.g. :class:`~email.mime.image.MIMEImage`). :exc:"
"`MultipartConversionError` multiply inherits from :exc:`MessageError` and "
"the built-in :exc:`TypeError`."

msgid ""
"Here is the list of the defects that the :class:`~email.parser.FeedParser` "
"can find while parsing messages.  Note that the defects are added to the "
"message where the problem was found, so for example, if a message nested "
"inside a :mimetype:`multipart/alternative` had a malformed header, that "
"nested message object would have a defect, but the containing messages would "
"not."

"All defect classes are subclassed from :class:`email.errors.MessageDefect`."

msgid "A \"Unix From\" header was found in the middle of a header block."

msgid ""
"A line was found while parsing headers that had no leading white space but "

"first line of the body."

msgid ""
"A message claimed to be a :mimetype:`multipart`, but no subparts were found. "
"Note that when a message has this defect, its :meth:`~email.message.Message."
"is_multipart` method may return ``False`` even though its content type "
"claims to be :mimetype:`multipart`."

"When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the padding was not correct. "
"Enough padding is added to perform the decode, but the resulting decoded "
"bytes may be invalid."

"When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, characters outside the base64 "
"alphabet were encountered.  The characters are ignored, but the resulting "
"decoded bytes may be invalid."

"When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the number of non-padding "
"base64 characters was invalid (1 more than a multiple of 4).  The encoded "
"block was kept as-is."
