msgid ":mod:`!stringprep` --- Internet String Preparation"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/stringprep.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When identifying things (such as host names) in the internet, it is often "
"necessary to compare such identifications for \"equality\". Exactly how this "
"comparison is executed may depend on the application domain, e.g. whether it "
"should be case-insensitive or not. It may be also necessary to restrict the "
"possible identifications, to allow only identifications consisting of "
"\"printable\" characters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":rfc:`3454` defines a procedure for \"preparing\" Unicode strings in "
"internet protocols. Before passing strings onto the wire, they are processed "
"with the preparation procedure, after which they have a certain normalized "
"form. The RFC defines a set of tables, which can be combined into profiles. "
"Each profile must define which tables it uses, and what other optional parts "
"of the ``stringprep`` procedure are part of the profile. One example of a "
"``stringprep`` profile is ``nameprep``, which is used for internationalized "
"domain names."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module :mod:`stringprep` only exposes the tables from :rfc:`3454`. As "
"these tables would be very large to represent as dictionaries or lists, the "
"module uses the Unicode character database internally. The module source "
"code itself was generated using the ``mkstringprep.py`` utility."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, these tables are exposed as functions, not as data structures. "
"There are two kinds of tables in the RFC: sets and mappings. For a set, :mod:"
"`stringprep` provides the \"characteristic function\", i.e. a function that "
"returns ``True`` if the parameter is part of the set. For mappings, it "
"provides the mapping function: given the key, it returns the associated "
"value. Below is a list of all functions available in the module."
