msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/xml/`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python's interfaces for processing XML are grouped in the ``xml`` package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data, see :ref:`xml-"
"security`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important to note that modules in the :mod:`xml` package require that "
"there be at least one SAX-compliant XML parser available. The Expat parser "
"is included with Python, so the :mod:`xml.parsers.expat` module will always "
"be available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The documentation for the :mod:`xml.dom` and :mod:`xml.sax` packages are the "
"definition of the Python bindings for the DOM and SAX interfaces."
msgstr ""

msgid "The XML handling submodules are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree`: the ElementTree API, a simple and lightweight "
"XML processor"
msgstr ""

msgid ":mod:`xml.dom`: the DOM API definition"
msgstr ""

msgid ":mod:`xml.dom.minidom`: a minimal DOM implementation"
msgstr ""

msgid ":mod:`xml.dom.pulldom`: support for building partial DOM trees"
msgstr ""

msgid ":mod:`xml.sax`: SAX2 base classes and convenience functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ":mod:`xml.parsers.expat`: the Expat parser binding"
msgstr ""

msgid "XML security"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An attacker can abuse XML features to carry out denial of service attacks, "
"access local files, generate network connections to other machines, or "
"circumvent firewalls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Expat versions lower that 2.6.0 may be vulnerable to \"billion laughs\", "
"\"quadratic blowup\" and \"large tokens\". Python may be vulnerable if it "
"uses such older versions of Expat as a system-provided library. Check :const:"
"`!pyexpat.EXPAT_VERSION`."
msgstr ""

msgid ":mod:`xmlrpc` is **vulnerable** to the \"decompression bomb\" attack."
msgstr ""

msgid "billion laughs / exponential entity expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Billion Laughs`_ attack -- also known as exponential entity expansion "
"-- uses multiple levels of nested entities. Each entity refers to another "
"entity several times, and the final entity definition contains a small "
"string. The exponential expansion results in several gigabytes of text and "
"consumes lots of memory and CPU time."
msgstr ""

msgid "quadratic blowup entity expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A quadratic blowup attack is similar to a `Billion Laughs`_ attack; it "
"abuses entity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one "
"large entity with a couple of thousand chars over and over again. The attack "
"isn't as efficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering parser "
"countermeasures that forbid deeply nested entities."
msgstr ""

msgid "decompression bomb"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decompression bombs (aka `ZIP bomb`_) apply to all XML libraries that can "
"parse compressed XML streams such as gzipped HTTP streams or LZMA-compressed "
"files. For an attacker it can reduce the amount of transmitted data by three "
"magnitudes or more."
msgstr ""
"Dekompressionsbomber (även kallade `ZIP bomb`_) gäller alla XML-bibliotek "
"som kan analysera komprimerade XML-strömmar, t.ex. gzippade HTTP-strömmar "
"eller LZMA-komprimerade filer. För en angripare kan det minska mängden "
"överförd data med tre magnituder eller mer."

msgid "large tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Expat needs to re-parse unfinished tokens; without the protection introduced "
"in Expat 2.6.0, this can lead to quadratic runtime that can be used to cause "
"denial of service in the application parsing XML. The issue is known as :cve:"
"`2023-52425`."
