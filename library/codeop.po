msgid ":mod:`!codeop` --- Compile Python code"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/codeop.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python read-eval-"
"print loop can be emulated, as is done in the :mod:`code` module.  As a "
"result, you probably don't want to use the module directly; if you want to "
"include such a loop in your program you probably want to use the :mod:`code` "
"module instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two parts to this job:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Being able to tell if a line of input completes a Python statement: in "
"short, telling whether to print '``>>>``' or '``...``' next."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remembering which future statements the user has entered, so subsequent "
"input can be compiled with these in effect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`codeop` module provides a way of doing each of these things, and a "
"way of doing them both."
msgstr ""

msgid "To do just the former:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tries to compile *source*, which should be a string of Python code and "
"return a code object if *source* is valid Python code.  In that case, the "
"filename attribute of the code object will be *filename*, which defaults to "
"``'<input>'``.  Returns ``None`` if *source* is *not* valid Python code, but "
"is a prefix of valid Python code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there is a problem with *source*, an exception will be raised. :exc:"
"`SyntaxError` is raised if there is invalid Python syntax, and :exc:"
"`OverflowError` or :exc:`ValueError` if there is an invalid literal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *symbol* argument determines whether *source* is compiled as a statement "
"(``'single'``, the default), as a sequence of :term:`statement` (``'exec'``) "
"or as an :term:`expression` (``'eval'``).  Any other value will cause :exc:"
"`ValueError` to be raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a "
"successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this case, "
"trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.  For example, a "
"backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by arbitrary garbage. "
"This will be fixed once the API for the parser is better."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances of this class have :meth:`~object.__call__` methods identical in "
"signature to the built-in function :func:`compile`, but with the difference "
"that if the instance compiles program text containing a :mod:`__future__` "
"statement, the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program "
"texts with the statement in force."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances of this class have :meth:`~object.__call__` methods identical in "
"signature to :func:`compile_command`; the difference is that if the instance "
"compiles program text containing a :mod:`__future__` statement, the instance "
"'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts with the statement in "
