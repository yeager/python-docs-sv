"The :mod:`asyncio` module is designed to be portable, but some platforms "
"have subtle differences and limitations due to the platforms' underlying "
"architecture and capabilities."

msgid "All Platforms"

msgid ""
":meth:`loop.add_reader` and :meth:`loop.add_writer` cannot be used to "
"monitor file I/O."

msgstr ""

msgid "All event loops on Windows do not support the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`loop.create_unix_connection` and :meth:`loop.create_unix_server` are "
"not supported. The :const:`socket.AF_UNIX` socket family is specific to Unix."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`loop.add_signal_handler` and :meth:`loop.remove_signal_handler` are "
"not supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`SelectorEventLoop` has the following limitations:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`~selectors.SelectSelector` is used to wait on socket events: it "
"supports sockets and is limited to 512 sockets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`loop.add_reader` and :meth:`loop.add_writer` only accept socket "
"handles (e.g. pipe file descriptors are not supported)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pipes are not supported, so the :meth:`loop.connect_read_pipe` and :meth:"
"`loop.connect_write_pipe` methods are not implemented."

"The resolution of the monotonic clock on Windows is usually around 15.6 "
"milliseconds.  The best resolution is 0.5 milliseconds. The resolution "
"depends on the hardware (availability of `HPET <https://en.wikipedia.org/"
"wiki/High_Precision_Event_Timer>`_) and on the Windows configuration."

msgid ""
"On macOS 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8, the default event loop uses :class:`selectors."
