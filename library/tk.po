"Tk/Tcl has long been an integral part of Python.  It provides a robust and "
"platform independent windowing toolkit, that is available to Python "
"programmers using the :mod:`tkinter` package, and its extension, the :mod:"
"`tkinter.ttk` module."

"The :mod:`tkinter` package is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. "
"To use :mod:`tkinter`, you don't need to write Tcl code, but you will need "
"to consult the Tk documentation, and occasionally the Tcl documentation. :"
"mod:`tkinter` is a set of wrappers that implement the Tk widgets as Python "
"classes."

":mod:`tkinter`'s chief virtues are that it is fast, and that it usually "
"comes bundled with Python. Although its standard documentation is weak, good "
"material is available, which includes: references, tutorials, a book and "
"others. :mod:`tkinter` is also famous for having an outdated look and feel, "
"which has been vastly improved in Tk 8.5. Nevertheless, there are many other "
"GUI libraries that you could be interested in. The Python wiki lists several "
"alternative `GUI frameworks and tools <https://wiki.python.org/moin/"
"GuiProgramming>`_."
