msgid ":mod:`!ssl` --- TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/ssl.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides access to Transport Layer Security (often known as "
"\"Secure Sockets Layer\") encryption and peer authentication facilities for "
"network sockets, both client-side and server-side.  This module uses the "
"OpenSSL library. It is available on all modern Unix systems, Windows, macOS, "
"and probably additional platforms, as long as OpenSSL is installed on that "
"platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some behavior may be platform dependent, since calls are made to the "
"operating system socket APIs.  The installed version of OpenSSL may also "
"cause variations in behavior. For example, TLSv1.3 comes with OpenSSL "
"version 1.1.1."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't use this module without reading the :ref:`ssl-security`.  Doing so may "
"lead to a false sense of security, as the default settings of the ssl module "
"are not necessarily appropriate for your application."
msgstr ""

msgid "Availability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly. See :ref:`wasm-"
"availability` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section documents the objects and functions in the ``ssl`` module; for "
"more general information about TLS, SSL, and certificates, the reader is "
"referred to the documents in the \"See Also\" section at the bottom."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides a class, :class:`ssl.SSLSocket`, which is derived from "
"the :class:`socket.socket` type, and provides a socket-like wrapper that "
"also encrypts and decrypts the data going over the socket with SSL.  It "
"supports additional methods such as :meth:`getpeercert`, which retrieves the "
"certificate of the other side of the connection, :meth:`cipher`, which "
"retrieves the cipher being used for the secure connection or :meth:"
"`get_verified_chain`, :meth:`get_unverified_chain` which retrieves "
"certificate chain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more sophisticated applications, the :class:`ssl.SSLContext` class helps "
"manage settings and certificates, which can then be inherited by SSL sockets "
"created through the :meth:`SSLContext.wrap_socket` method."
