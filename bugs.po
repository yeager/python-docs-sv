"and submitted to the developers."

"The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the problem has "

"developers' time, is that you learn what has been done to fix it; it may be "
"that the problem has already been fixed for the next release, or additional "
"information is needed (in which case you are welcome to provide it if you "
"can!). To do this, search the tracker using the search box at the top of the "
"page."
