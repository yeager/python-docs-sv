"<bufferobjects>` as a Python object which can then be passed around like any "
"other object."

"Create a memoryview object from an object that provides the buffer "
"interface. If *obj* supports writable buffer exports, the memoryview object "
"will be read/write, otherwise it may be either read-only or read/write at "
"the discretion of the exporter."

"function."

msgid ""
"Create a memoryview object to a :term:`contiguous` chunk of memory (in "
"either 'C' or 'F'ortran *order*) from an object that defines the buffer "
"interface. If memory is contiguous, the memoryview object points to the "
"original memory. Otherwise, a copy is made and the memoryview points to a "

"*mview* **must** be a memoryview instance; this macro doesn't check its "
