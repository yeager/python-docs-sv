"Python lists have a built-in :meth:`list.sort` method that modifies the list "
"in-place.  There is also a :func:`sorted` built-in function that builds a "
"new sorted list from an iterable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this document, we explore the various techniques for sorting data using "
"Python."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sorting Basics"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the :func:`sorted` function. "
"It returns a new sorted list:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> sorted([5, 2, 3, 1, 4])\n"
"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the :meth:`list.sort` method. It modifies the list in-place "
"(and returns ``None`` to avoid confusion). Usually it's less convenient "
"than :func:`sorted` - but if you don't need the original list, it's slightly "
"more efficient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> a = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]\n"
">>> a.sort()\n"
">>> a\n"
"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another difference is that the :meth:`list.sort` method is only defined for "
"lists. In contrast, the :func:`sorted` function accepts any iterable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> sorted({1: 'D', 2: 'B', 3: 'B', 4: 'E', 5: 'A'})\n"
"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
msgstr ""

msgid "Key Functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`list.sort` method and the functions :func:`sorted`, :func:`min`, :"
"func:`max`, :func:`heapq.nsmallest`, and :func:`heapq.nlargest` have a *key* "
"parameter to specify a function (or other callable) to be called on each "
"list element prior to making comparisons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, here's a case-insensitive string comparison using :meth:`str."
"casefold`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> sorted(\"This is a test string from Andrew\".split(), key=str.casefold)\n"
"['a', 'Andrew', 'from', 'is', 'string', 'test', 'This']"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The value of the *key* parameter should be a function (or other callable) "
"that takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. "
"This technique is fast because the key function is called exactly once for "
"each input record."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common pattern is to sort complex objects using some of the object's "
"indices as keys. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> student_tuples = [\n"
"...     ('john', 'A', 15),\n"
"...     ('jane', 'B', 12),\n"
"...     ('dave', 'B', 10),\n"
"... ]\n"
">>> sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2])   # sort by age\n"
"[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same technique works for objects with named attributes. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> class Student:\n"
"...     def __init__(self, name, grade, age):\n"
"...         self.name = name\n"
"...         self.grade = grade\n"
"...         self.age = age\n"
"...     def __repr__(self):\n"
"...         return repr((self.name, self.grade, self.age))\n"
"\n"
">>> student_objects = [\n"
"...     Student('john', 'A', 15),\n"
"...     Student('jane', 'B', 12),\n"
"...     Student('dave', 'B', 10),\n"
"... ]\n"
">>> sorted(student_objects, key=lambda student: student.age)   # sort by "
"age\n"
"[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects with named attributes can be made by a regular class as shown above, "
"or they can be instances of :class:`~dataclasses.dataclass` or a :term:"
"`named tuple`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Operator Module Functions and Partial Function Evaluation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :term:`key function` patterns shown above are very common, so Python "
"provides convenience functions to make accessor functions easier and faster. "
"The :mod:`operator` module has :func:`~operator.itemgetter`, :func:"
"`~operator.attrgetter`, and a :func:`~operator.methodcaller` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using those functions, the above examples become simpler and faster:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> from operator import itemgetter, attrgetter\n"
"\n"
">>> sorted(student_tuples, key=itemgetter(2))\n"
"[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]\n"
"\n"
">>> sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('age'))\n"
"[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The operator module functions allow multiple levels of sorting. For example, "
"to sort by *grade* then by *age*:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> sorted(student_tuples, key=itemgetter(1,2))\n"
"[('john', 'A', 15), ('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12)]\n"
"\n"
">>> sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('grade', 'age'))\n"
"[('john', 'A', 15), ('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`functools` module provides another helpful tool for making key-"
"functions.  The :func:`~functools.partial` function can reduce the `arity "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity>`_ of a multi-argument function making "
"it suitable for use as a key-function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> from functools import partial\n"
">>> from unicodedata import normalize\n"
"\n"
">>> names = 'Zoë Åbjørn Núñez Élana Zeke Abe Nubia Eloise'.split()\n"
"\n"
">>> sorted(names, key=partial(normalize, 'NFD'))\n"
"['Abe', 'Åbjørn', 'Eloise', 'Élana', 'Nubia', 'Núñez', 'Zeke', 'Zoë']\n"
"\n"
">>> sorted(names, key=partial(normalize, 'NFC'))\n"
"['Abe', 'Eloise', 'Nubia', 'Núñez', 'Zeke', 'Zoë', 'Åbjørn', 'Élana']"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ascending and Descending"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both :meth:`list.sort` and :func:`sorted` accept a *reverse* parameter with "
"a boolean value. This is used to flag descending sorts. For example, to get "
"the student data in reverse *age* order:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> sorted(student_tuples, key=itemgetter(2), reverse=True)\n"
"[('john', 'A', 15), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('dave', 'B', 10)]\n"
"\n"
">>> sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('age'), reverse=True)\n"
"[('john', 'A', 15), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('dave', 'B', 10)]"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sort Stability and Complex Sorts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sorts are guaranteed to be `stable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Sorting_algorithm#Stability>`_\\. That means that when multiple records have "
"the same key, their original order is preserved."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> data = [('red', 1), ('blue', 1), ('red', 2), ('blue', 2)]\n"
">>> sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0))\n"
"[('blue', 1), ('blue', 2), ('red', 1), ('red', 2)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how the two records for *blue* retain their original order so that "
"``('blue', 1)`` is guaranteed to precede ``('blue', 2)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This wonderful property lets you build complex sorts in a series of sorting "
"steps. For example, to sort the student data by descending *grade* and then "
"ascending *age*, do the *age* sort first and then sort again using *grade*:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> s = sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('age'))     # sort on "
"secondary key\n"
">>> sorted(s, key=attrgetter('grade'), reverse=True)       # now sort on "
"primary key, descending\n"
"[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can be abstracted out into a wrapper function that can take a list and "
"tuples of field and order to sort them on multiple passes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> def multisort(xs, specs):\n"
"...     for key, reverse in reversed(specs):\n"
"...         xs.sort(key=attrgetter(key), reverse=reverse)\n"
"...     return xs\n"
"\n"
">>> multisort(list(student_objects), (('grade', True), ('age', False)))\n"
"[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Timsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_ algorithm used in "
"Python does multiple sorts efficiently because it can take advantage of any "
"ordering already present in a dataset."
msgstr ""

msgid "Decorate-Sort-Undecorate"
msgstr ""

msgid "This idiom is called Decorate-Sort-Undecorate after its three steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, the initial list is decorated with new values that control the sort "
"order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Second, the decorated list is sorted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the decorations are removed, creating a list that contains only the "
"initial values in the new order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, to sort the student data by *grade* using the DSU approach:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> decorated = [(student.grade, i, student) for i, student in "
"enumerate(student_objects)]\n"
">>> decorated.sort()\n"
">>> [student for grade, i, student in decorated]               # undecorate\n"
"[('john', 'A', 15), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('dave', 'B', 10)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This idiom works because tuples are compared lexicographically; the first "
"items are compared; if they are the same then the second items are compared, "
"and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is not strictly necessary in all cases to include the index *i* in the "
"decorated list, but including it gives two benefits:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sort is stable -- if two items have the same key, their order will be "
"preserved in the sorted list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The original items do not have to be comparable because the ordering of the "
"decorated tuples will be determined by at most the first two items. So for "
"example the original list could contain complex numbers which cannot be "
"sorted directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another name for this idiom is `Schwartzian transform <https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform>`_\\, after Randal L. Schwartz, who "
"popularized it among Perl programmers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that Python sorting provides key-functions, this technique is not often "
"needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Comparison Functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike key functions that return an absolute value for sorting, a comparison "
"function computes the relative ordering for two inputs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, a `balance scale <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/"
"commons/1/17/Balance_à_tabac_1850.JPG>`_ compares two samples giving a "
"relative ordering: lighter, equal, or heavier. Likewise, a comparison "
"function such as ``cmp(a, b)`` will return a negative value for less-than, "
"zero if the inputs are equal, or a positive value for greater-than."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is common to encounter comparison functions when translating algorithms "
"from other languages.  Also, some libraries provide comparison functions as "
"part of their API.  For example, :func:`locale.strcoll` is a comparison "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To accommodate those situations, Python provides :class:`functools."
"cmp_to_key` to wrap the comparison function to make it usable as a key "
"function::"
msgstr ""

msgid "sorted(words, key=cmp_to_key(strcoll))  # locale-aware sort order"
msgstr ""

msgid "Strategies For Unorderable Types and Values"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A number of type and value issues can arise when sorting. Here are some "
"strategies that can help:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Convert non-comparable input types to strings prior to sorting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> data = ['twelve', '11', 10]\n"
">>> sorted(map(str, data))\n"
"['10', '11', 'twelve']"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is needed because most cross-type comparisons raise a :exc:`TypeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remove special values prior to sorting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> from math import isnan\n"
">>> from itertools import filterfalse\n"
">>> data = [3.3, float('nan'), 1.1, 2.2]\n"
">>> sorted(filterfalse(isnan, data))\n"
"[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is needed because the `IEEE-754 standard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"IEEE_754>`_ specifies that, \"Every NaN shall compare unordered with "
"everything, including itself.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Likewise, ``None`` can be stripped from datasets as well:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> data = [3.3, None, 1.1, 2.2]\n"
">>> sorted(x for x in data if x is not None)\n"
"[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is needed because ``None`` is not comparable to other types."
msgstr ""

msgid "Convert mapping types into sorted item lists before sorting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> data = [{'a': 1}, {'b': 2}]\n"
">>> sorted(data, key=lambda d: sorted(d.items()))\n"
"[{'a': 1}, {'b': 2}]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is needed because dict-to-dict comparisons raise a :exc:`TypeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Convert set types into sorted lists before sorting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> data = [{'a', 'b', 'c'}, {'b', 'c', 'd'}]\n"
">>> sorted(map(sorted, data))\n"
"[['a', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 'c', 'd']]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is needed because the elements contained in set types do not have a "
"deterministic order.  For example, ``list({'a', 'b'})`` may produce either "
"``['a', 'b']`` or ``['b', 'a']``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Odds and Ends"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For locale aware sorting, use :func:`locale.strxfrm` for a key function or :"
"func:`locale.strcoll` for a comparison function.  This is necessary because "
"\"alphabetical\" sort orderings can vary across cultures even if the "
"underlying alphabet is the same."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *reverse* parameter still maintains sort stability (so that records with "
"equal keys retain the original order). Interestingly, that effect can be "
"simulated without the parameter by using the builtin :func:`reversed` "
"function twice:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> data = [('red', 1), ('blue', 1), ('red', 2), ('blue', 2)]\n"
">>> standard_way = sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0), reverse=True)\n"
">>> double_reversed = list(reversed(sorted(reversed(data), "
"key=itemgetter(0))))\n"
">>> assert standard_way == double_reversed\n"
">>> standard_way\n"
"[('red', 1), ('red', 2), ('blue', 1), ('blue', 2)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sort routines use ``<`` when making comparisons between two objects. So, "
"it is easy to add a standard sort order to a class by defining an :meth:"
"`~object.__lt__` method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> Student.__lt__ = lambda self, other: self.age < other.age\n"
">>> sorted(student_objects)\n"
"[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, note that ``<`` can fall back to using :meth:`~object.__gt__` if :"
"meth:`~object.__lt__` is not implemented (see :func:`object.__lt__` for "
"details on the mechanics).  To avoid surprises, :pep:`8` recommends that all "
"six comparison methods be implemented. The :func:`~functools.total_ordering` "
"decorator is provided to make that task easier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Key functions need not depend directly on the objects being sorted. A key "
"function can also access external resources. For instance, if the student "
"grades are stored in a dictionary, they can be used to sort a separate list "
"of student names:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> students = ['dave', 'john', 'jane']\n"
">>> newgrades = {'john': 'F', 'jane':'A', 'dave': 'C'}\n"
">>> sorted(students, key=newgrades.__getitem__)\n"
"['jane', 'dave', 'john']"
msgstr ""

msgid "Partial Sorts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some applications require only some of the data to be ordered.  The standard "
"library provides several tools that do less work than a full sort:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`min` and :func:`max` return the smallest and largest values, "
"respectively.  These functions make a single pass over the input data and "
"require almost no auxiliary memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`heapq.nsmallest` and :func:`heapq.nlargest` return the *n* smallest "
"and largest values, respectively.  These functions make a single pass over "
"the data keeping only *n* elements in memory at a time.  For values of *n* "
"that are small relative to the number of inputs, these functions make far "
"fewer comparisons than a full sort."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`heapq.heappush` and :func:`heapq.heappop` create and maintain a "
"partially sorted arrangement of data that keeps the smallest element at "
"position ``0``.  These functions are suitable for implementing priority "
"queues which are commonly used for task scheduling."
msgstr ""
