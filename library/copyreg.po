msgid ":mod:`!copyreg` --- Register :mod:`!pickle` support functions"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/copyreg.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`copyreg` module offers a way to define functions used while "
"pickling specific objects.  The :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`copy` modules use "
"those functions when pickling/copying those objects.  The module provides "
"configuration information about object constructors which are not classes. "
"Such constructors may be factory functions or class instances."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Declares *object* to be a valid constructor.  If *object* is not callable "
"(and hence not valid as a constructor), raises :exc:`TypeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Declares that *function* should be used as a \"reduction\" function for "
"objects of type *type*.  *function* must return either a string or a tuple "
"containing between two and six elements. See the :attr:`~pickle.Pickler."
"dispatch_table` for more details on the interface of *function*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *constructor_ob* parameter is a legacy feature and is now ignored, but "
"if passed it must be a callable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the :attr:`~pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table` attribute of a pickler "
"object or subclass of :class:`pickle.Pickler` can also be used for declaring "
"reduction functions."
