msgid ""
"The :class:`~netrc.netrc` class parses and encapsulates the netrc file "
"format used by the Unix :program:`ftp` program and other FTP clients."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`~netrc.netrc` instance or subclass instance encapsulates data "
"from  a netrc file.  The initialization argument, if present, specifies the "
"file to parse.  If no argument is given, the file :file:`.netrc` in the "
"user's home directory -- as determined by :func:`os.path.expanduser` -- will "
"be read.  Otherwise, a :exc:`FileNotFoundError` exception will be raised. "
"Parse errors will raise :exc:`NetrcParseError` with diagnostic information "
"including the file name, line number, and terminating token."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no argument is specified on a POSIX system, the presence of passwords in "
"the :file:`.netrc` file will raise a :exc:`NetrcParseError` if the file "
"ownership or permissions are insecure (owned by a user other than the user "
"running the process, or accessible for read or write by any other user). "
"This implements security behavior equivalent to that of ftp and other "
"programs that use :file:`.netrc`. Such security checks are not available on "
"platforms that do not support :func:`os.getuid`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the POSIX permission check."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`os.path.expanduser` is used to find the location of the :file:`."
"netrc` file when *file* is not passed as argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`netrc` try UTF-8 encoding before using locale specific encoding. The "
"entry in the netrc file no longer needs to contain all tokens.  The missing "
"tokens' value default to an empty string.  All the tokens and their values "
"now can contain arbitrary characters, like whitespace and non-ASCII "
"characters. If the login name is anonymous, it won't trigger the security "
"check."

"Exception raised by the :class:`~netrc.netrc` class when syntactical errors "
"are encountered in source text.  Instances of this exception provide three "
"interesting attributes:"

msgid "Textual explanation of the error."

msgid "The name of the source file."

msgid "The line number on which the error was found."

msgid "A :class:`~netrc.netrc` instance has the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a 3-tuple ``(login, account, password)`` of authenticators for "
"*host*. If the netrc file did not contain an entry for the given host, "
"return the tuple associated with the 'default' entry.  If neither matching "
"host nor default entry is available, return ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Dump the class data as a string in the format of a netrc file. (This "
"discards comments and may reorder the entries.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Instances of :class:`~netrc.netrc` have public instance variables:"

"'default' entry, if any, is represented as a pseudo-host by that name."
