"Serialize *obj* as a JSON formatted stream to *fp* (a ``.write()``-"

msgid ""
"Unlike :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`marshal`, JSON is not a framed protocol, so "

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Python object to be serialized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The file-like object *obj* will be serialized to. The :mod:`!json` module "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``True``, keys that are not of a basic type (:class:`str`, :class:`int`, :"
"class:`float`, :class:`bool`, ``None``) will be skipped instead of raising "

msgid ""
"If ``False``, the circular reference check for container types is skipped "
"and a circular reference will result in a :exc:`RecursionError` (or worse). "
"Default ``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``False``, serialization of out-of-range :class:`float` values (``nan``, "
"``inf``, ``-inf``) will result in a :exc:`ValueError`, in strict compliance "
"with the JSON specification. If ``True`` (the default), their JavaScript "
"equivalents (``NaN``, ``Infinity``, ``-Infinity``) are used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If set, a custom JSON encoder with the :meth:`~JSONEncoder.default` method "
"overridden, for serializing into custom datatypes. If ``None`` (the "
"default), :class:`!JSONEncoder` is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a positive integer or string, JSON array elements and object members will "
"be pretty-printed with that indent level. A positive integer indents that "
"many spaces per level; a string (such as ``\"\\t\"``) is used to indent each "
"level. If zero, negative, or ``\"\"`` (the empty string), only newlines are "

msgstr ""
