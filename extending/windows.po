msgid "Building C and C++ Extensions on Windows"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This chapter briefly explains how to create a Windows extension module for "
"Python using Microsoft Visual C++, and follows with more detailed background "
"information on how it works.  The explanatory material is useful for both "
"the Windows programmer learning to build Python extensions and the Unix "
"programmer interested in producing software which can be successfully built "
"on both Unix and Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Module authors are encouraged to use the distutils approach for building "
"extension modules, instead of the one described in this section. You will "
"still need the C compiler that was used to build Python; typically Microsoft "
"Visual C++."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This chapter mentions a number of filenames that include an encoded Python "
"version number.  These filenames are represented with the version number "
"shown as ``XY``; in practice, ``'X'`` will be the major version number and "
"``'Y'`` will be the minor version number of the Python release you're "
"working with.  For example, if you are using Python 2.2.1, ``XY`` will "
"actually be ``22``."
msgstr ""

msgid "A Cookbook Approach"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two approaches to building extension modules on Windows, just as "
"there are on Unix: use the ``setuptools`` package to control the build "
"process, or do things manually.  The setuptools approach works well for most "
"extensions; documentation on using ``setuptools`` to build and package "
"extension modules is available in :ref:`setuptools-index`.  If you find you "
"really need to do things manually, it may be instructive to study the "
"project file for the :source:`winsound <PCbuild/winsound.vcxproj>` standard "
"library module."

msgid "Differences Between Unix and Windows"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unix and Windows use completely different paradigms for run-time loading of "
"code.  Before you try to build a module that can be dynamically loaded, be "
"aware of how your system works."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Unix, a shared object (:file:`.so`) file contains code to be used by the "
"program, and also the names of functions and data that it expects to find in "
"the program.  When the file is joined to the program, all references to "
"those functions and data in the file's code are changed to point to the "
"actual locations in the program where the functions and data are placed in "
"memory. This is basically a link operation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Windows, a dynamic-link library (:file:`.dll`) file has no dangling "
"references.  Instead, an access to functions or data goes through a lookup "
"table.  So the DLL code does not have to be fixed up at runtime to refer to "
"the program's memory; instead, the code already uses the DLL's lookup table, "
"and the lookup table is modified at runtime to point to the functions and "
"data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Unix, there is only one type of library file (:file:`.a`) which contains "
"code from several object files (:file:`.o`).  During the link step to create "
"a shared object file (:file:`.so`), the linker may find that it doesn't know "
"where an identifier is defined.  The linker will look for it in the object "
"files in the libraries; if it finds it, it will include all the code from "
"that object file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Windows, there are two types of library, a static library and an import "
"library (both called :file:`.lib`).  A static library is like a Unix :file:`."
"a` file; it contains code to be included as necessary. An import library is "
"basically used only to reassure the linker that a certain identifier is "
"legal, and will be present in the program when the DLL is loaded.  So the "
"linker uses the information from the import library to build the lookup "
"table for using identifiers that are not included in the DLL.  When an "
"application or a DLL is linked, an import library may be generated, which "
"will need to be used for all future DLLs that depend on the symbols in the "
"application or DLL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Suppose you are building two dynamic-load modules, B and C, which should "
"share another block of code A.  On Unix, you would *not* pass :file:`A.a` to "
"the linker for :file:`B.so` and :file:`C.so`; that would cause it to be "
"included twice, so that B and C would each have their own copy.  In Windows, "
"building :file:`A.dll` will also build :file:`A.lib`.  You *do* pass :file:"
"`A.lib` to the linker for B and C.  :file:`A.lib` does not contain code; it "
"just contains information which will be used at runtime to access A's code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Windows, using an import library is sort of like using ``import spam``; "
"it gives you access to spam's names, but does not create a separate copy.  "
"On Unix, linking with a library is more like ``from spam import *``; it does "
"create a separate copy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Turn off the implicit, ``#pragma``-based linkage with the Python library, "
"performed inside CPython header files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using DLLs in Practice"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Windows Python is built in Microsoft Visual C++; using other compilers may "
"or may not work.  The rest of this section is MSVC++ specific."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating DLLs in Windows, you can use the CPython library in two ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, inclusion of :file:`PC/pyconfig.h` directly or via :file:`Python."
"h` triggers an implicit, configure-aware link with the library.  The header "
"file chooses :file:`pythonXY_d.lib` for Debug, :file:`pythonXY.lib` for "
"Release, and :file:`pythonX.lib` for Release with the :ref:`Limited API "
"<stable-application-binary-interface>` enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To build two DLLs, spam and ni (which uses C functions found in spam), you "
"could use these commands::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"cl /LD /I/python/include spam.c\n"
"cl /LD /I/python/include ni.c spam.lib"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first command created three files: :file:`spam.obj`, :file:`spam.dll` "
"and :file:`spam.lib`.  :file:`Spam.dll` does not contain any Python "
"functions (such as :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple`), but it does know how to find "
"the Python code thanks to the implicitly linked :file:`pythonXY.lib`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second command created :file:`ni.dll` (and :file:`.obj` and :file:`."
"lib`), which knows how to find the necessary functions from spam, and also "
"from the Python executable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Manually by defining :c:macro:`Py_NO_LINK_LIB` macro before including :file:"
"`Python.h`. You must pass :file:`pythonXY.lib` to the linker."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"cl /LD /DPy_NO_LINK_LIB /I/python/include spam.c ../libs/pythonXY.lib\n"
"cl /LD /DPy_NO_LINK_LIB /I/python/include ni.c spam.lib ../libs/pythonXY.lib"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first command created three files: :file:`spam.obj`, :file:`spam.dll` "
"and :file:`spam.lib`.  :file:`Spam.dll` does not contain any Python "
"functions (such as :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple`), but it does know how to find "
"the Python code thanks to :file:`pythonXY.lib`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not every identifier is exported to the lookup table.  If you want any other "
"modules (including Python) to be able to see your identifiers, you have to "
"say ``_declspec(dllexport)``, as in ``void _declspec(dllexport) "
"initspam(void)`` or ``PyObject _declspec(dllexport) *NiGetSpamData(void)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Developer Studio will throw in a lot of import libraries that you do not "
"really need, adding about 100K to your executable.  To get rid of them, use "
"the Project Settings dialog, Link tab, to specify *ignore default "
"libraries*.  Add the correct :file:`msvcrt{xx}.lib` to the list of libraries."
