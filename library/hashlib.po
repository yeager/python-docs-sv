"This module implements a common interface to many different hash algorithms. "
"Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, "
"(defined in `the FIPS 180-4 standard`_), the SHA-3 series (defined in `the "

"There is one constructor method named for each type of :dfn:`hash`.  All "

"term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` (normally :class:`bytes`) "
"using the :meth:`update<hash.update>` method.  At any point you can ask it "

"Constructors for hash algorithms that are always present in this module are :"

msgid "Constructors"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Is a generic constructor that takes the string *name* of the desired "

"above listed hashes as well as any other algorithms that your OpenSSL "

msgstr ""

msgid "Using :func:`new` with an algorithm name:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Named constructors such as these are faster than passing an algorithm name "
"to :func:`new`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Attributes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hashlib provides the following constant module attributes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A set containing the names of the hash algorithms guaranteed to be supported "
"by this module on all platforms.  Note that 'md5' is in this list despite "
"some upstream vendors offering an odd \"FIPS compliant\" Python build that "
"excludes it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A set containing the names of the hash algorithms that are available in the "
"running Python interpreter.  These names will be recognized when passed to :"
"func:`new`.  :attr:`algorithms_guaranteed` will always be a subset.  The "

"(thanks to OpenSSL)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hash Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following values are provided as constant attributes of the hash objects "
"returned by the constructors:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The size of the resulting hash in bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid "The internal block size of the hash algorithm in bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid "A hash object has the following attributes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The canonical name of this hash, always lowercase and always suitable as a "
"parameter to :func:`new` to create another hash of this type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The name attribute has been present in CPython since its inception, but "
"until Python 3.4 was not formally specified, so may not exist on some "
"platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "A hash object has the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Update the hash object with the :term:`bytes-like object`. Repeated calls "
"are equivalent to a single call with the concatenation of all the arguments: "
"``m.update(a); m.update(b)`` is equivalent to ``m.update(a+b)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the digest of the data passed to the :meth:`update` method so far. "
"This is a bytes object of size :attr:`digest_size` which may contain bytes "
"in the whole range from 0 to 255."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :meth:`digest` except the digest is returned as a string object of "
"double length, containing only hexadecimal digits.  This may be used to "
"exchange the value safely in email or other non-binary environments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a copy (\"clone\") of the hash object.  This can be used to "
"efficiently compute the digests of data sharing a common initial substring."
msgstr ""

msgid "SHAKE variable length digests"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`shake_128` and :func:`shake_256` algorithms provide variable "
"length digests with length_in_bits//2 up to 128 or 256 bits of security. As "
"such, their digest methods require a length. Maximum length is not limited "
"by the SHAKE algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"The hashlib module provides a helper function for efficient hashing of a "
"file or file-like object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a digest object that has been updated with contents of file object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*fileobj* must be a file-like object opened for reading in binary mode. It "
"accepts file objects from  builtin :func:`open`, :class:`~io.BytesIO` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function may bypass Python's I/O and use the file descriptor from :meth:"

"state after this function returns or raises. It is up to the caller to close "
"*fileobj*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*digest* must either be a hash algorithm name as a *str*, a hash "
"constructor, or a callable that returns a hash object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now raises a :exc:`BlockingIOError` if the file is opened in blocking mode. "
"Previously, spurious null bytes were added to the digest."
msgstr ""

msgid "Key derivation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Key derivation and key stretching algorithms are designed for secure "
"password hashing. Naive algorithms such as ``sha1(password)`` are not "
"resistant against brute-force attacks. A good password hashing function must "

"Salt_%28cryptography%29>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function provides PKCS#5 password-based key derivation function 2. It "
"uses HMAC as pseudorandom function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The string *hash_name* is the desired name of the hash digest algorithm for "

"proper source, e.g. :func:`os.urandom`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of *iterations* should be chosen based on the hash algorithm and "
"computing power. As of 2022, hundreds of thousands of iterations of SHA-256 "
"are suggested. For rationale as to why and how to choose what is best for "
"your application, read *Appendix A.2.2* of NIST-SP-800-132_. The answers on "
"the `stackexchange pbkdf2 iterations question`_ explain in detail."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*dklen* is the length of the derived key in bytes. If *dklen* is ``None`` "

msgid ""
"*password* and *salt* must be :term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like "

"length (e.g. 1024).  *salt* should be about 16 or more bytes from a proper "
"source, e.g. :func:`os.urandom`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*n* is the CPU/Memory cost factor, *r* the block size, *p* parallelization "

msgid "Simple hashing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To calculate hash of some data, you should first construct a hash object by "
"calling the appropriate constructor function (:func:`blake2b` or :func:"
"`blake2s`), then update it with the data by calling :meth:`~hash.update` on "

"`~hash.digest` (or :meth:`~hash.hexdigest` for hex-encoded string)."

"As a shortcut, you can pass the first chunk of data to update directly to "
"the constructor as the positional argument:"

msgstr ""

msgid "Using different digest sizes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"BLAKE2 has configurable size of digests up to 64 bytes for BLAKE2b and up to "
"32 bytes for BLAKE2s. For example, to replace SHA-1 with BLAKE2b without "
"changing the size of output, we can tell BLAKE2b to produce 20-byte digests:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hash objects with different digest sizes have completely different outputs "
"(shorter hashes are *not* prefixes of longer hashes); BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s "
"produce different outputs even if the output length is the same:"

msgid "Keyed hashing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keyed hashing can be used for authentication as a faster and simpler "
"replacement for `Hash-based message authentication code <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC>`_ (HMAC). BLAKE2 can be securely used in prefix-MAC "

"By setting *salt* parameter users can introduce randomization to the hash "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Randomized hashing is designed for situations where one party, the message "
"preparer, generates all or part of a message to be signed by a second party, "
"the message signer. If the message preparer is able to find cryptographic "
"hash function collisions (i.e., two messages producing the same hash value), "
"then they might prepare meaningful versions of the message that would "
"produce the same hash value and digital signature, but with different "
"results (e.g., transferring $1,000,000 to an account, rather than $10). "
"Cryptographic hash functions have been designed with collision resistance as "
"a major goal, but the current concentration on attacking cryptographic hash "
"functions may result in a given cryptographic hash function providing less "
"collision resistance than expected. Randomized hashing offers the signer "
"additional protection by reducing the likelihood that a preparer can "
"generate two or more messages that ultimately yield the same hash value "
"during the digital signature generation process --- even if it is practical "
"to find collisions for the hash function. However, the use of randomized "
"hashing may reduce the amount of security provided by a digital signature "
"when all portions of the message are prepared by the signer."
