msgid ":mod:`!poplib` --- POP3 protocol client"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/poplib.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module defines a class, :class:`POP3`, which encapsulates a connection "
"to a POP3 server and implements the protocol as defined in :rfc:`1939`. The :"
"class:`POP3` class supports both the minimal and optional command sets from :"
"rfc:`1939`. The :class:`POP3` class also supports the ``STLS`` command "
"introduced in :rfc:`2595` to enable encrypted communication on an already "
"established connection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, this module provides a class :class:`POP3_SSL`, which provides "
"support for connecting to POP3 servers that use SSL as an underlying "
"protocol layer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that POP3, though widely supported, is obsolescent.  The implementation "
"quality of POP3 servers varies widely, and too many are quite poor. If your "
"mailserver supports IMAP, you would be better off using the :class:`imaplib."
"IMAP4` class, as IMAP servers tend to be better implemented."
msgstr ""

msgid "Availability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly. See :ref:`wasm-"
"availability` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`poplib` module provides two classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class implements the actual POP3 protocol.  The connection is created "
"when the instance is initialized. If *port* is omitted, the standard POP3 "
"port (110) is used. The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in "
"seconds for the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default "
"timeout setting will be used)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``poplib.connect`` with arguments "
"``self``, ``host``, ``port``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All commands will raise an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``poplib."
"putline`` with arguments ``self`` and ``line``, where ``line`` is the bytes "
"about to be sent to the remote host."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *timeout* parameter is set to be zero, it will raise a :class:"
"`ValueError` to prevent the creation of a non-blocking socket."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a subclass of :class:`POP3` that connects to the server over an SSL "
"encrypted socket.  If *port* is not specified, 995, the standard POP3-over-"
"SSL port is used.  *timeout* works as in the :class:`POP3` constructor. "
"*context* is an optional :class:`ssl.SSLContext` object which allows "
"bundling SSL configuration options, certificates and private keys into a "
"single (potentially long-lived) structure.  Please read :ref:`ssl-security` "
"for best practices."
msgstr ""

msgid "*context* parameter added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The class now supports hostname check with :attr:`ssl.SSLContext."
"check_hostname` and *Server Name Indication* (see :const:`ssl.HAS_SNI`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The deprecated *keyfile* and *certfile* parameters have been removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "One exception is defined as an attribute of the :mod:`poplib` module:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception raised on any errors from this module (errors from :mod:`socket` "
"module are not caught). The reason for the exception is passed to the "
"constructor as a string."

msgstr ""

msgid "The standard Python IMAP module."

"`Frequently Asked Questions About Fetchmail <http://www.catb.org/~esr/"
"fetchmail/fetchmail-FAQ.html>`_"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The FAQ for the :program:`fetchmail` POP/IMAP client collects information on "
"POP3 server variations and RFC noncompliance that may be useful if you need "
"to write an application based on the POP protocol."
msgstr ""

msgid "POP3 Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All POP3 commands are represented by methods of the same name, in lowercase; "
"most return the response text sent by the server."
msgstr ""

msgid "A :class:`POP3` instance has the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the instance's debugging level.  This controls the amount of debugging "
"output printed.  The default, ``0``, produces no debugging output.  A value "
"of ``1`` produces a moderate amount of debugging output, generally a single "
"line per request.  A value of ``2`` or higher produces the maximum amount of "
"debugging output, logging each line sent and received on the control "
"connection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns the greeting string sent by the POP3 server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Query the server's capabilities as specified in :rfc:`2449`. Returns a "
"dictionary in the form ``{'name': ['param'...]}``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Send user command, response should indicate that a password is required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Send password, response includes message count and mailbox size. Note: the "
"mailbox on the server is locked until :meth:`~POP3.quit` is called."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use the more secure APOP authentication to log into the POP3 server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use RPOP authentication (similar to UNIX r-commands) to log into POP3 server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Get mailbox status.  The result is a tuple of 2 integers: ``(message count, "
"mailbox size)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Request message list, result is in the form ``(response, ['mesg_num "
"octets', ...], octets)``. If *which* is set, it is the message to list."

"form ``(response, ['line', ...], octets)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Flag message number *which* for deletion.  On most servers deletions are not "
"actually performed until QUIT (the major exception is Eudora QPOP, which "
"deliberately violates the RFCs by doing pending deletes on any disconnect)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remove any deletion marks for the mailbox."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do nothing.  Might be used as a keep-alive."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signoff:  commit changes, unlock mailbox, drop connection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Retrieves the message header plus *howmuch* lines of the message after the "
"header of message number *which*. Result is in form ``(response, "
"['line', ...], octets)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The POP3 TOP command this method uses, unlike the RETR command, doesn't set "
"the message's seen flag; unfortunately, TOP is poorly specified in the RFCs "
"and is frequently broken in off-brand servers. Test this method by hand "
"against the POP3 servers you will use before trusting it."
msgstr ""
