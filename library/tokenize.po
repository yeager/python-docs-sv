msgid ":mod:`!tokenize` --- Tokenizer for Python source"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/tokenize.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source "
"code, implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as "
"tokens as well, making it useful for implementing \"pretty-printers\", "
"including colorizers for on-screen displays."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To simplify token stream handling, all :ref:`operator <operators>` and :ref:"
"`delimiter <delimiters>` tokens and :data:`Ellipsis` are returned using the "
"generic :data:`~token.OP` token type.  The exact type can be determined by "
"checking the ``exact_type`` property on the :term:`named tuple` returned "
"from :func:`tokenize.tokenize`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the functions in this module are only designed to parse "
"syntactically valid Python code (code that does not raise when parsed using :"
"func:`ast.parse`).  The behavior of the functions in this module is "
"**undefined** when providing invalid Python code and it can change at any "
"point."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tokenizing Input"
msgstr ""

msgid "The primary entry point is a :term:`generator`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`.tokenize` generator requires one argument, *readline*, which "
"must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the :meth:`io."
"IOBase.readline` method of file objects.  Each call to the function should "
"return one line of input as bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the "
"token string; a 2-tuple ``(srow, scol)`` of ints specifying the row and "
"column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple ``(erow, ecol)`` of "
"ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and "
"the line on which the token was found. The line passed (the last tuple item) "
"is the *physical* line.  The 5 tuple is returned as a :term:`named tuple` "
"with the field names: ``type string start end line``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The returned :term:`named tuple` has an additional property named "
"``exact_type`` that contains the exact operator type for :data:`~token.OP` "
"tokens.  For all other token types ``exact_type`` equals the named tuple "
"``type`` field."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for named tuples."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for ``exact_type``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`.tokenize` determines the source encoding of the file by looking for "
"a UTF-8 BOM or encoding cookie, according to :pep:`263`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tokenize a source reading unicode strings instead of bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :func:`.tokenize`, the *readline* argument is a callable returning a "
"single line of input. However, :func:`generate_tokens` expects *readline* to "
"return a str object rather than bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result is an iterator yielding named tuples, exactly like :func:`."
"tokenize`. It does not yield an :data:`~token.ENCODING` token."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All constants from the :mod:`token` module are also exported from :mod:"
"`tokenize`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another function is provided to reverse the tokenization process. This is "
"useful for creating tools that tokenize a script, modify the token stream, "
"and write back the modified script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Converts tokens back into Python source code.  The *iterable* must return "
"sequences with at least two elements, the token type and the token string. "
"Any additional sequence elements are ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result is guaranteed to tokenize back to match the input so that the "
"conversion is lossless and round-trips are assured.  The guarantee applies "
"only to the token type and token string as the spacing between tokens "
"(column positions) may change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It returns bytes, encoded using the :data:`~token.ENCODING` token, which is "
"the first token sequence output by :func:`.tokenize`. If there is no "
"encoding token in the input, it returns a str instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`.tokenize` needs to detect the encoding of source files it tokenizes. "
"The function it uses to do this is available:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`detect_encoding` function is used to detect the encoding that "
"should be used to decode a Python source file. It requires one argument, "
"readline, in the same way as the :func:`.tokenize` generator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used (as a "
"string) and a list of any lines (not decoded from bytes) it has read in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It detects the encoding from the presence of a UTF-8 BOM or an encoding "
"cookie as specified in :pep:`263`. If both a BOM and a cookie are present, "
"but disagree, a :exc:`SyntaxError` will be raised. Note that if the BOM is "
"found, ``'utf-8-sig'`` will be returned as an encoding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no encoding is specified, then the default of ``'utf-8'`` will be "
"returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use :func:`.open` to open Python source files: it uses :func:"
"`detect_encoding` to detect the file encoding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open a file in read only mode using the encoding detected by :func:"
"`detect_encoding`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raised when either a docstring or expression that may be split over several "
"lines is not completed anywhere in the file, for example::"

msgid "Command-Line Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`tokenize` module can be executed as a script from the command "
"line. It is as simple as:"
msgstr ""

msgid "python -m tokenize [-e] [filename.py]"
msgstr ""

msgid "The following options are accepted:"
msgstr ""

msgid "show this help message and exit"
msgstr ""

msgid "display token names using the exact type"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :file:`filename.py` is specified its contents are tokenized to stdout. "
"Otherwise, tokenization is performed on stdin."
