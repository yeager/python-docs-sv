msgid ":mod:`!atexit` --- Exit handlers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`atexit` module defines functions to register and unregister "
"cleanup functions.  Functions thus registered are automatically executed "
"upon normal interpreter termination.  :mod:`atexit` runs these functions in "
"the *reverse* order in which they were registered; if you register ``A``, "
"``B``, and ``C``, at interpreter termination time they will be run in the "
"order ``C``, ``B``, ``A``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Note:** The functions registered via this module are not called when the "
"program is killed by a signal not handled by Python, when a Python fatal "
"internal error is detected, or when :func:`os._exit` is called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Note:** The effect of registering or unregistering functions from within a "
"cleanup function is undefined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When used with C-API subinterpreters, registered functions are local to the "
"interpreter they were registered in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Register *func* as a function to be executed at termination.  Any optional "
"arguments that are to be passed to *func* must be passed as arguments to :"
"func:`register`.  It is possible to register the same function and arguments "
"more than once."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At normal program termination (for instance, if :func:`sys.exit` is called "
"or the main module's execution completes), all functions registered are "
"called in last in, first out order.  The assumption is that lower level "
"modules will normally be imported before higher level modules and thus must "
"be cleaned up later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an exception is raised during execution of the exit handlers, a traceback "
"is printed (unless :exc:`SystemExit` is raised) and the exception "
"information is saved.  After all exit handlers have had a chance to run, the "
"last exception to be raised is re-raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function returns *func*, which makes it possible to use it as a "
"decorator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Starting new threads or calling :func:`os.fork` from a registered function "
"can lead to race condition between the main Python runtime thread freeing "
"thread states while internal :mod:`threading` routines or the new process "
"try to use that state. This can lead to crashes rather than clean shutdown."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Attempts to start a new thread or :func:`os.fork` a new process in a "
"registered function now leads to :exc:`RuntimeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remove *func* from the list of functions to be run at interpreter shutdown. :"
"func:`unregister` silently does nothing if *func* was not previously "
"registered.  If *func* has been registered more than once, every occurrence "
"of that function in the :mod:`atexit` call stack will be removed.  Equality "
"comparisons (``==``) are used internally during unregistration, so function "
"references do not need to have matching identities."

"The following simple example demonstrates how a module can initialize a "
"counter from a file when it is imported and save the counter's updated value "
"automatically when the program terminates without relying on the application "
"making an explicit call into this module at termination. ::"
