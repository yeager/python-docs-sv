"``fma(inf, 0, nan)``. In these cases, ``math.fma`` returns a NaN, and does "
"not raise any exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the floating-point remainder of ``x / y``, as defined by the platform "
"C library function ``fmod(x, y)``. Note that the Python expression ``x % y`` "
"may not return the same result.  The intent of the C standard is that "
"``fmod(x, y)`` be exactly (mathematically; to infinite precision) equal to "
"``x - n*y`` for some integer *n* such that the result has the same sign as "
"*x* and magnitude less than ``abs(y)``.  Python's ``x % y`` returns a result "
"with the sign of *y* instead, and may not be exactly computable for float "
"arguments. For example, ``fmod(-1e-100, 1e100)`` is ``-1e-100``, but the "
"result of Python's ``-1e-100 % 1e100`` is ``1e100-1e-100``, which cannot be "
"represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising ``1e100``.  For "
"this reason, function :func:`fmod` is generally preferred when working with "
"floats, while Python's ``x % y`` is preferred when working with integers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the fractional and integer parts of *x*.  Both results carry the sign "
"of *x* and are floats."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that :func:`modf` has a different call/return pattern than its C "

"is no such thing in Python)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the IEEE 754-style remainder of *x* with respect to *y*.  For finite "
"*x* and finite nonzero *y*, this is the difference ``x - n*y``, where ``n`` "
"is the closest integer to the exact value of the quotient ``x / y``.  If "
"``x / y`` is exactly halfway between two consecutive integers, the nearest "
"*even* integer is used for ``n``.  The remainder ``r = remainder(x, y)`` "
"thus always satisfies ``abs(r) <= 0.5 * abs(y)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Special cases follow IEEE 754: in particular, ``remainder(x, math.inf)`` is "
"*x* for any finite *x*, and ``remainder(x, 0)`` and ``remainder(math.inf, "
"x)`` raise :exc:`ValueError` for any non-NaN *x*. If the result of the "
"remainder operation is zero, that zero will have the same sign as *x*."
msgstr ""

"On platforms using IEEE 754 binary floating point, the result of this "
"operation is always exactly representable: no rounding error is introduced."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return *x* with the fractional part removed, leaving the integer part.  This "
"rounds toward 0: ``trunc()`` is equivalent to :func:`floor` for positive "
"*x*, and equivalent to :func:`ceil` for negative *x*. If *x* is not a float, "
"delegates to :meth:`x.__trunc__ <object.__trunc__>`, which should return an :"
"class:`~numbers.Integral` value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the :func:`ceil`, :func:`floor`, and :func:`modf` functions, note that "
"*all* floating-point numbers of sufficiently large magnitude are exact "
"integers. Python floats typically carry no more than 53 bits of precision "
"(the same as the platform C double type), in which case any float *x* with "
"``abs(x) >= 2**52`` necessarily has no fractional bits."
msgstr ""

msgid "Floating point manipulation functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a float with the magnitude (absolute value) of *x* but the sign of "
"*y*.  On platforms that support signed zeros, ``copysign(1.0, -0.0)`` "
"returns *-1.0*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the mantissa and exponent of *x* as the pair ``(m, e)``.  *m* is a "
"float and *e* is an integer such that ``x == m * 2**e`` exactly. If *x* is "
"zero, returns ``(0.0, 0)``, otherwise ``0.5 <= abs(m) < 1``.  This is used "

"*rel_tol* is the relative tolerance -- it is the maximum allowed difference "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*abs_tol* is the absolute tolerance; it defaults to ``0.0`` and it must be "
