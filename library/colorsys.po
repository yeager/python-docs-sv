msgid ""
"The :mod:`colorsys` module defines bidirectional conversions of color values "
"between colors expressed in the RGB (Red Green Blue) color space used in "
"computer monitors and three other coordinate systems: YIQ, HLS (Hue "
"Lightness Saturation) and HSV (Hue Saturation Value).  Coordinates in all of "
"these color spaces are floating-point values.  In the YIQ space, the Y "
"coordinate is between 0 and 1, but the I and Q coordinates can be positive "
"or negative.  In all other spaces, the coordinates are all between 0 and 1."
