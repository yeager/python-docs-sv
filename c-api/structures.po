msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are a large number of structures which are used in the definition of "
"object types for Python.  This section describes these structures and how "
"they are used."

msgid "Base object types and macros"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All Python objects ultimately share a small number of fields at the "
"beginning of the object's representation in memory.  These are represented "
"by the :c:type:`PyObject` and :c:type:`PyVarObject` types, which are "
"defined, in turn, by the expansions of some macros also used, whether "
"directly or indirectly, in the definition of all other Python objects.  "
"Additional macros can be found under :ref:`reference counting "
"<countingrefs>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All object types are extensions of this type.  This is a type which contains "
"the information Python needs to treat a pointer to an object as an object.  "
"In a normal \"release\" build, it contains only the object's reference count "
"and a pointer to the corresponding type object. Nothing is actually declared "
"to be a :c:type:`PyObject`, but every pointer to a Python object can be cast "
"to a :c:expr:`PyObject*`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The members must not be accessed directly; instead use macros such as :c:"
"macro:`Py_REFCNT` and :c:macro:`Py_TYPE`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object's reference count, as returned by :c:macro:`Py_REFCNT`. Do not "

"Methods without parameters don't need to check whether arguments are given "

msgid ""
"The method will be loaded in place of existing definitions.  Without "

"*sq_contains* slot, for example, would generate a wrapped method named :meth:"
"`~object.__contains__` and preclude the loading of a corresponding "
"PyCFunction with the same name.  With the flag defined, the PyCFunction will "
"be loaded in place of the wrapper object and will co-exist with the slot.  "
