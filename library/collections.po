msgid ""
"A :class:`ChainMap` class is provided for quickly linking a number of "

"calls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The class can be used to simulate nested scopes and is useful in templating."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`ChainMap` groups multiple dicts or other mappings together to "
"create a single, updateable view.  If no *maps* are specified, a single "
"empty dictionary is provided so that a new chain always has at least one "
"mapping."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The underlying mappings are stored in a list.  That list is public and can "
"be accessed or updated using the *maps* attribute.  There is no other state."

"Lookups search the underlying mappings successively until a key is found.  "
"In contrast, writes, updates, and deletions only operate on the first "

"A :class:`ChainMap` incorporates the underlying mappings by reference.  So, "
"if one of the underlying mappings gets updated, those changes will be "
"reflected in :class:`ChainMap`."

"*maps* attribute, a method for creating new subcontexts, and a property for "
"accessing all but the first mapping:"

"used, so that a call to ``d.new_child()`` is equivalent to: ``ChainMap({}, "
"*d.maps)``. If any keyword arguments are specified, they update passed map "
"or new empty dict. This method is used for creating subcontexts that can be "
