msgid ":mod:`!os.path` --- Common pathname manipulations"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module implements some useful functions on pathnames. To read or write "
"files see :func:`open`, and for accessing the filesystem see the :mod:`os` "
"module. The path parameters can be passed as strings, or bytes, or any "
"object implementing the :class:`os.PathLike` protocol."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike a Unix shell, Python does not do any *automatic* path expansions. "
"Functions such as :func:`expanduser` and :func:`expandvars` can be invoked "
"explicitly when an application desires shell-like path expansion.  (See also "
"the :mod:`glob` module.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`pathlib` module offers high-level path objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All of these functions accept either only bytes or only string objects as "
"their parameters.  The result is an object of the same type, if a path or "
"file name is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since different operating systems have different path name conventions, "
"there are several versions of this module in the standard library.  The :mod:"
"`os.path` module is always the path module suitable for the operating system "
"Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths.  However, you "
"can also import and use the individual modules if you want to manipulate a "
"path that is *always* in one of the different formats.  They all have the "
"same interface:"

":func:`exists`, :func:`lexists`, :func:`isdir`, :func:`isfile`, :func:"
"`islink`, and :func:`ismount` now return ``False`` instead of raising an "
"exception for paths that contain characters or bytes unrepresentable at the "
"OS level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a normalized absolutized version of the pathname *path*. On most "
"platforms, this is equivalent to calling the function :func:`normpath` as "
"follows: ``normpath(join(os.getcwd(), path))``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accepts a :term:`path-like object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the base name of pathname *path*.  This is the second element of the "
"pair returned by passing *path* to the function :func:`split`.  Note that "
"the result of this function is different from the Unix :program:`basename` "
"program; where :program:`basename` for ``'/foo/bar/'`` returns ``'bar'``, "
"the :func:`basename` function returns an empty string (``''``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the longest common sub-path of each pathname in the iterable "
"*paths*.  Raise :exc:`ValueError` if *paths* contain both absolute and "
"relative pathnames, if *paths* are on different drives, or if *paths* is "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*path* can now be an integer: ``True`` is returned if it is an  open file "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if *path* refers to an existing path, including broken "
"symbolic links.   Equivalent to :func:`exists` on platforms lacking :func:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Unix and Windows, return the argument with an initial component of ``~`` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Unix, an initial ``~`` is replaced by the environment variable :envvar:"

msgid ""
"On Windows, :envvar:`USERPROFILE` will be used if set, otherwise a "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, ``%name%`` expansions are supported in addition to ``$name`` and "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the time of last access of *path*.  The return value is a floating-"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the time of last modification of *path*.  The return value is a "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the system's ctime which, on some systems (like Unix) is the time of "

"since the epoch (see the  :mod:`time` module).  Raise :exc:`OSError` if the "
"file does not exist or is inaccessible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the size, in bytes, of *path*.  Raise :exc:`OSError` if the file does "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if *path* is an absolute pathname.  On Unix, that means it "
"begins with a slash, on Windows that it begins with two (back)slashes, or a "
"drive letter, colon, and (back)slash together."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, returns ``False`` if the given path starts with exactly one "
"(back)slash."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if *path* is an :func:`existing <exists>` regular file. This "
"follows symbolic links, so both :func:`islink` and :func:`isfile` can be "
"true for the same path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if *path* is an :func:`existing <exists>` directory.  This "
"follows symbolic links, so both :func:`islink` and :func:`isdir` can be true "
"for the same path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if *path* refers to an :func:`existing <lexists>` directory "
"entry that is a junction.  Always return ``False`` if junctions are not "
"supported on the current platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if *path* refers to an :func:`existing <exists>` directory "
"entry that is a symbolic link.  Always ``False`` if symbolic links are not "
"supported by the Python runtime."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if pathname *path* is a :dfn:`mount point`: a point in a "
"file system where a different file system has been mounted.  On POSIX, the "
"function checks whether *path*'s parent, :file:`{path}/..`, is on a "
"different device than *path*, or whether :file:`{path}/..` and *path* point "
"to the same i-node on the same device --- this should detect mount points "
"for all Unix and POSIX variants.  It is not able to reliably detect bind "
"mounts on the same filesystem. On Linux systems, it will always return "
"``True`` for btrfs subvolumes, even if they aren't mount points. On Windows, "
"a drive letter root and a share UNC are always mount points, and for any "
"other path ``GetVolumePathName`` is called to see if it is different from "
"the input path."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for detecting non-root mount points on Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if pathname *path* is located on a Windows Dev Drive. A Dev "
"Drive is optimized for developer scenarios, and offers faster performance "
"for reading and writing files. It is recommended for use for source code, "
"temporary build directories, package caches, and other IO-intensive "
"operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"May raise an error for an invalid path, for example, one without a "
"recognizable drive, but returns ``False`` on platforms that do not support "
"Dev Drives. See `the Windows documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/"
"windows/dev-drive/>`_ for information on enabling and creating Dev Drives."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function is now available on all platforms, and will always return "
"``False`` on those that have no support for Dev Drives"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return ``True`` if *path* is a reserved pathname on the current system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, reserved filenames include those that end with a space or dot; "
"those that contain colons (i.e. file streams such as \"name:stream\"), "
"wildcard characters (i.e. ``'*?\"<>'``), pipe, or ASCII control characters; "
"as well as DOS device names such as \"NUL\", \"CON\", \"CONIN$\", \"CONOUT$"
"\", \"AUX\", \"PRN\", \"COM1\", and \"LPT1\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function approximates rules for reserved paths on most Windows systems. "
"These rules change over time in various Windows releases. This function may "
"be updated in future Python releases as changes to the rules become broadly "
"available."
msgstr ""

msgid "Availability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Join one or more path segments intelligently.  The return value is the "
"concatenation of *path* and all members of *\\*paths*, with exactly one "
"directory separator following each non-empty part, except the last. That is, "
"the result will only end in a separator if the last part is either empty or "
"ends in a separator. If a segment is an absolute path (which on Windows "
"requires both a drive and a root), then all previous segments are ignored "
"and joining continues from the absolute path segment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, the drive is not reset when a rooted path segment (e.g., "
"``r'\\foo'``) is encountered. If a segment is on a different drive or is an "
"absolute path, all previous segments are ignored and the drive is reset. "
"Note that since there is a current directory for each drive, ``os.path."
"join(\"c:\", \"foo\")`` represents a path relative to the current directory "
"on drive :file:`C:` (:file:`c:foo`), not :file:`c:\\\\foo`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accepts a :term:`path-like object` for *path* and *paths*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normalize the case of a pathname.  On Windows, convert all characters in the "
"pathname to lowercase, and also convert forward slashes to backward slashes. "
"On other operating systems, return the path unchanged."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normalize a pathname by collapsing redundant separators and up-level "
"references so that ``A//B``, ``A/B/``, ``A/./B`` and ``A/foo/../B`` all "
"become ``A/B``.  This string manipulation may change the meaning of a path "
"that contains symbolic links.  On Windows, it converts forward slashes to "
"backward slashes. To normalize case, use :func:`normcase`."

msgid ""
"On POSIX systems, in accordance with `IEEE Std 1003.1 2013 Edition; 4.13 "
"Pathname Resolution <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/"
"basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_13>`_, if a pathname begins with exactly two "
"slashes, the first component following the leading characters may be "

"leading characters shall be treated as a single character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the canonical path of the specified filename, eliminating any "
"symbolic links encountered in the path (if they are supported by the "
"operating system). On Windows, this function will also resolve MS-DOS (also "
"called 8.3) style names such as ``C:\\\\PROGRA~1`` to ``C:\\\\Program "
"Files``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the path is evaluated up to the first component that does not "
"exist, is a symlink loop, or whose evaluation raises :exc:`OSError`. All "
"such components are appended unchanged to the existing part of the path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some errors that are handled this way include \"access denied\", \"not a "
"directory\", or \"bad argument to internal function\". Thus, the resulting "
"path may be missing or inaccessible, may still contain links or loops, and "
"may traverse non-directories."
msgstr ""

msgid "This behavior can be modified by keyword arguments:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *strict* is ``True``, the first error encountered when evaluating the "
"path is re-raised. In particular, :exc:`FileNotFoundError` is raised if "
"*path* does not exist, or another :exc:`OSError` if it is otherwise "
"inaccessible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *strict* is :py:data:`os.path.ALLOW_MISSING`, errors other than :exc:"
"`FileNotFoundError` are re-raised (as with ``strict=True``). Thus, the "
"returned path will not contain any symbolic links, but the named file and "
"some of its parent directories may be missing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function emulates the operating system's procedure for making a path "
"canonical, which differs slightly between Windows and UNIX with respect to "
"how links and subsequent path components interact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Operating system APIs make paths canonical as needed, so it's not normally "
"necessary to call this function."

msgid ""
"Return a relative filepath to *path* either from the current directory or "

"*start*.  On Windows, :exc:`ValueError` is raised when *path* and *start* "
"are on different drives."
msgstr ""

msgid "*start* defaults to :data:`os.curdir`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if both pathname arguments refer to the same file or "
"directory. This is determined by the device number and i-node number and "
