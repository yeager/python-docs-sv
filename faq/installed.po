"Python is a programming language.  It's used for many different "
"applications. It's used in some high schools and colleges as an introductory "
"programming language because Python is easy to learn, but it's also used by "
"professional software developers at places such as Google, NASA, and "
"Lucasfilm Ltd."

msgid ""
"If you wish to learn more about Python, start with the `Beginner's Guide to "

msgid "Why is Python installed on my machine?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you find Python installed on your system but don't remember installing "
"it, there are several possible ways it could have gotten there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Perhaps another user on the computer wanted to learn programming and "
"installed it; you'll have to figure out who's been using the machine and "
"might have installed it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A third-party application installed on the machine might have been written "
"in Python and included a Python installation.  There are many such "
"applications, from GUI programs to network servers and administrative "
"scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some Windows machines also have Python installed.  At this writing we're "
"aware of computers from Hewlett-Packard and Compaq that include Python.  "
"Apparently some of HP/Compaq's administrative tools are written in Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many Unix-compatible operating systems, such as macOS and some Linux "
"distributions, have Python installed by default; it's included in the base "
"installation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Can I delete Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That depends on where Python came from."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If someone installed it deliberately, you can remove it without hurting "
"anything.  On Windows, use the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If Python was installed by a third-party application, you can also remove "
"it, but that application will no longer work.  You should use that "
"application's uninstaller rather than removing Python directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If Python came with your operating system, removing it is not recommended.  "
"If you remove it, whatever tools were written in Python will no longer run, "
"and some of them might be important to you.  Reinstalling the whole system "
"would then be required to fix things again."
