msgid "The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a historical document, provided as an appendix to the official "

"*This document is intended for Python programmers who want to understand the "
"C3 Method Resolution Order used in Python 2.3. Although it is not intended "
"for newbies, it is quite pedagogical with many worked out examples.  I am "
"not aware of other publicly available documents with the same scope, "
"therefore it should be useful.*"

"Everything started with a post by Samuele Pedroni to the Python development "
"mailing list [#]_.  In his post, Samuele showed that the Python 2.2 method "
"resolution order is not monotonic and he proposed to replace it with the C3 "
"method resolution order.  Guido agreed with his arguments and therefore now "
"Python 2.3 uses C3.  The C3 method itself has nothing to do with Python, "
"since it was invented by people working on Dylan and it is described in a "
"paper intended for lispers [#]_.  The present paper gives a (hopefully) "
"readable discussion of the C3 algorithm for Pythonistas who want to "
"understand the reasons for the change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First of all, let me point out that what I am going to say only applies to "
"the *new style classes* introduced in Python 2.2:  *classic classes* "
"maintain their old method resolution order, depth first and then left to "
"right.  Therefore, there is no breaking of old code for classic classes; and "
"even if in principle there could be breaking of code for Python 2.2 new "
"style classes, in practice the cases in which the C3 resolution order "
"differs from the Python 2.2 method resolution order are so rare that no real "
"breaking of code is expected.  Therefore:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Don't be scared!*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Moreover, unless you make strong use of multiple inheritance and you have "
"non-trivial hierarchies, you don't need to understand the C3 algorithm, and "
"you can easily skip this paper.  On the other hand, if you really want to "
"know how multiple inheritance works, then this paper is for you.  The good "
"news is that things are not as complicated as you might expect."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let me begin with some basic definitions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Given a class C in a complicated multiple inheritance hierarchy, it is a non-"
"trivial task to specify the order in which methods are overridden, i.e. to "
"specify the order of the ancestors of C."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The list of the ancestors of a class C, including the class itself, ordered "
"from the nearest ancestor to the furthest, is called the class precedence "
"list or the *linearization* of C."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Method Resolution Order* (MRO) is the set of rules that construct the "
"linearization.  In the Python literature, the idiom \"the MRO of C\" is also "
"used as a synonymous for the linearization of the class C."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For instance, in the case of single inheritance hierarchy, if C is a "
"subclass of C1, and C1 is a subclass of C2, then the linearization of C is "
"simply the list [C, C1 , C2].  However, with multiple inheritance "
"hierarchies, the construction of the linearization is more cumbersome, since "
"it is more difficult to construct a linearization that respects *local "
"precedence ordering* and *monotonicity*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I will discuss the local precedence ordering later, but I can give the "
"definition of monotonicity here.  A MRO is monotonic when the following is "
"true:  *if C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of C, then C1 precedes C2 in "
"the linearization of any subclass of C*. Otherwise, the innocuous operation "
"of deriving a new class could change the resolution order of methods, "
"potentially introducing very subtle bugs.  Examples where this happens will "
"be shown later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not all classes admit a linearization.  There are cases, in complicated "
"hierarchies, where it is not possible to derive a class such that its "
"linearization respects all the desired properties."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here I give an example of this situation. Consider the hierarchy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"which can be represented with the following inheritance graph, where I have "
"denoted with O the ``object`` class, which is the beginning of any hierarchy "
"for new style classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" -----------\n"
"|           |\n"
"|    O      |\n"
"|  /   \\    |\n"
" - X    Y  /\n"
"   |  / | /\n"
"   | /  |/\n"
"   A    B\n"
"   \\   /\n"
"     ?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case, it is not possible to derive a new class C from A and B, since "
"X precedes Y in A, but Y precedes X in B, therefore the method resolution "
"order would be ambiguous in C."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 2.3 raises an exception in this situation (TypeError:  MRO conflict "
"among bases Y, X) forbidding the naive programmer from creating ambiguous "
"hierarchies.  Python 2.2 instead does not raise an exception, but chooses an "
"*ad hoc* ordering (CABXYO in this case)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The C3 Method Resolution Order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let me introduce a few simple notations which will be useful for the "
"following discussion.  I will use the shortcut notation::"
msgstr ""

msgid "C1 C2 ... CN"
msgstr ""

msgid "to indicate the list of classes [C1, C2, ... , CN]."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *head* of the list is its first element::"
msgstr ""

msgid "head = C1"
msgstr ""

msgid "whereas the *tail* is the rest of the list::"
msgstr ""

msgid "tail = C2 ... CN."
msgstr ""

msgid "I shall also use the notation::"
msgstr ""

msgid "C + (C1 C2 ... CN) = C C1 C2 ... CN"
msgstr ""

msgid "to denote the sum of the lists [C] + [C1, C2, ... ,CN]."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now I can explain how the MRO works in Python 2.3."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider a class C in a multiple inheritance hierarchy, with C inheriting "
"from the base classes B1, B2, ...  , BN.  We want to compute the "
"linearization L[C] of the class C. The rule is the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*the linearization of C is the sum of C plus the merge of the linearizations "
"of the parents and the list of the parents.*"
msgstr ""

msgid "In symbolic notation::"
msgstr ""

msgid "L[C(B1 ... BN)] = C + merge(L[B1] ... L[BN], B1 ... BN)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In particular, if C is the ``object`` class, which has no parents, the "
"linearization is trivial::"
msgstr ""

msgid "L[object] = object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in general one has to compute the merge according to the following "
"prescription:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*take the head of the first list, i.e L[B1][0]; if this head is not in the "
"tail of any of the other lists, then add it to the linearization of C and "
"remove it from the lists in the merge, otherwise look at the head of the "
"next list and take it, if it is a good head.  Then repeat the operation "
"until all the class are removed or it is impossible to find good heads.  In "
"this case, it is impossible to construct the merge, Python 2.3 will refuse "
"to create the class C and will raise an exception.*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This prescription ensures that the merge operation *preserves* the ordering, "
"if the ordering can be preserved.  On the other hand, if the order cannot be "
"preserved (as in the example of serious order disagreement discussed above) "
"then the merge cannot be computed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The computation of the merge is trivial if C has only one parent (single "
"inheritance); in this case::"
msgstr ""

msgid "L[C(B)] = C + merge(L[B],B) = C + L[B]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in the case of multiple inheritance things are more cumbersome and "
"I don't expect you can understand the rule without a couple of examples ;-)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples"
msgstr ""

msgid "First example. Consider the following hierarchy:"

"It is clear that this linearization is *wrong*, since A comes before D "
"whereas in the linearization of K3 A comes *after* D. In other words, in K3 "
"methods derived by D override methods derived by A, but in Z, which still is "
"a subclass of K3, methods derived by A override methods derived by D!  This "
"is a violation of monotonicity.  Moreover, the Python 2.2 linearization of Z "
"is also inconsistent with local precedence ordering, since the local "
"precedence list of the class Z is [K1, K2, K3] (K2 precedes K3), whereas in "
"the linearization of Z K2 *follows* K3.  These problems explain why the 2.2 "
"rule has been dismissed in favor of the C3 rule."

"This section is for the impatient reader, who skipped all the previous "

"for the programmer with some hubris, otherwise s/he would not be reading a "
"paper on the C3 method resolution order in multiple inheritance "
"hierarchies ;-) These three virtues taken all together (and *not* "
"separately) deserve a prize:  the prize is a short Python 2.2 script that "
"allows you to compute the 2.3 MRO without risk to your brain.  Simply change "
