msgid ":mod:`!syslog` --- Unix syslog library routines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides an interface to the Unix ``syslog`` library routines. "
"Refer to the Unix manual pages for a detailed description of the ``syslog`` "
"facility."
msgstr ""

msgid "Availability"
msgstr "Tillgänglighet"

msgid ""
"This module wraps the system ``syslog`` family of routines.  A pure Python "
"library that can speak to a syslog server is available in the :mod:`logging."
"handlers` module as :class:`~logging.handlers.SysLogHandler`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Send the string *message* to the system logger.  A trailing newline is added "
"if necessary.  Each message is tagged with a priority composed of a "
"*facility* and a *level*.  The optional *priority* argument, which defaults "
"to :const:`LOG_INFO`, determines the message priority.  If the facility is "
"not encoded in *priority* using logical-or (``LOG_INFO | LOG_USER``), the "
"value given in the :func:`openlog` call is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :func:`openlog` has not been called prior to the call to :func:`syslog`, :"
"func:`openlog` will be called with no arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``syslog.syslog`` with arguments "
"``priority``, ``message``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In previous versions, :func:`openlog` would not be called automatically if "
"it wasn't called prior to the call to :func:`syslog`, deferring to the "
"syslog implementation to call ``openlog()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is restricted in subinterpreters. (Only code that runs in "
"multiple interpreters is affected and the restriction is not relevant for "
"most users.) :func:`openlog` must be called in the main interpreter before :"
"func:`syslog` may be used in a subinterpreter.  Otherwise it will raise :exc:"
"`RuntimeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Logging options of subsequent :func:`syslog` calls can be set by calling :"
"func:`openlog`.  :func:`syslog` will call :func:`openlog` with no arguments "
"if the log is not currently open."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The optional *ident* keyword argument is a string which is prepended to "
"every message, and defaults to ``sys.argv[0]`` with leading path components "
"stripped.  The optional *logoption* keyword argument (default is 0) is a bit "
"field -- see below for possible values to combine.  The optional *facility* "
"keyword argument (default is :const:`LOG_USER`) sets the default facility "
"for messages which do not have a facility explicitly encoded."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``syslog.openlog`` with arguments "
"``ident``, ``logoption``, ``facility``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In previous versions, keyword arguments were not allowed, and *ident* was "
"required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is restricted in subinterpreters. (Only code that runs in "
"multiple interpreters is affected and the restriction is not relevant for "
"most users.) This may only be called in the main interpreter. It will raise :"
"exc:`RuntimeError` if called in a subinterpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reset the syslog module values and call the system library ``closelog()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This causes the module to behave as it does when initially imported.  For "
"example, :func:`openlog` will be called on the first :func:`syslog` call "
"(if :func:`openlog` hasn't already been called), and *ident* and other :func:"
"`openlog` parameters are reset to defaults."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``syslog.closelog`` with no "
"arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the priority mask to *maskpri* and return the previous mask value.  "
"Calls to :func:`syslog` with a priority level not set in *maskpri* are "
"ignored. The default is to log all priorities.  The function "
"``LOG_MASK(pri)`` calculates the mask for the individual priority *pri*.  "
"The function ``LOG_UPTO(pri)`` calculates the mask for all priorities up to "
"and including *pri*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``syslog.setlogmask`` with "
"argument ``maskpri``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The module defines the following constants:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Priority levels (high to low)."
msgstr "Prioriteringsnivåer (hög till låg)."

msgid ""
"Facilities, depending on availability in ``<syslog.h>`` for :const:"
"`LOG_AUTHPRIV`, :const:`LOG_FTP`, :const:`LOG_NETINFO`, :const:"
"`LOG_REMOTEAUTH`, :const:`LOG_INSTALL` and :const:`LOG_RAS`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"const:`LOG_INSTALL`, :const:`LOG_RAS`, and :const:`LOG_LAUNCHD`."
