"Return ``1`` if the object provides the mapping protocol or supports "
"slicing, and ``0`` otherwise.  Note that it returns ``1`` for Python classes "
"with a :meth:`~object.__getitem__` method, since in general it is impossible "
"to determine what type of keys the class supports. This function always "
"succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the number of keys in object *o* on success, and ``-1`` on failure. "
"This is equivalent to the Python expression ``len(o)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the same as :c:func:`PyObject_GetItem`, but *key* is specified as a :"
"c:expr:`const char*` UTF-8 encoded bytes string, rather than a :c:expr:"
"`PyObject*`."

msgid ""
"Variant of :c:func:`PyObject_GetItem` which doesn't raise :exc:`KeyError` if "
"the key is not found."

"If the key is found, return ``1`` and set *\\*result* to a new :term:`strong "
"reference` to the corresponding value. If the key is not found, return ``0`` "

"error other than :exc:`KeyError` is raised, return ``-1`` and set "
"*\\*result* to ``NULL``."
