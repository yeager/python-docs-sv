"An instance method is a wrapper for a :c:type:`PyCFunction` and the new way "
"to bind a :c:type:`PyCFunction` to a class object. It replaces the former "
"call ``PyMethod_New(func, NULL, class)``."

"method type. It is not exposed to Python programs."

"`PyInstanceMethod_Type`).  The parameter must not be ``NULL``. This function "
"always succeeds."
