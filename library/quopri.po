"This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as "
"defined in :rfc:`1521`: \"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part "
"One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message "
"Bodies\". The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there are "
"relatively few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme available "
"via the :mod:`base64` module is more compact if there are many such "
"characters, as when sending a graphics file."

"Decode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting decoded "
"binary data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be :term:`binary "
"file objects <file object>`.  If the optional argument *header* is present "
"and true, underscore will be decoded as space. This is used to decode \"Q\"-"
"encoded headers as described in :rfc:`1522`: \"MIME (Multipurpose Internet "
"Mail Extensions) Part Two: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text\"."

"`binary file objects <file object>`. *quotetabs*, a non-optional flag which "
"controls whether to encode embedded spaces and tabs; when true it encodes "
"such embedded whitespace, and when false it leaves them unencoded. Note that "
"spaces and tabs appearing at the end of lines are always encoded, as per :"
"rfc:`1521`.  *header* is a flag which controls if spaces are encoded as "
