msgid ":mod:`!csv` --- CSV File Reading and Writing"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/csv.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import "
"and export format for spreadsheets and databases.  CSV format was used for "
"many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a standardized way "
"in :rfc:`4180`.  The lack of a well-defined standard means that subtle "
"differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by different "
"applications.  These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files "
"from multiple sources. Still, while the delimiters and quoting characters "
"vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a "
"single module which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details "
"of reading and writing the data from the programmer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`csv` module implements classes to read and write tabular data in "
"CSV format.  It allows programmers to say, \"write this data in the format "
"preferred by Excel,\" or \"read data from this file which was generated by "
"Excel,\" without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by "
"Excel.  Programmers can also describe the CSV formats understood by other "
"applications or define their own special-purpose CSV formats."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`csv` module's :class:`reader` and :class:`writer` objects read and "
"write sequences.  Programmers can also read and write data in dictionary "
"form using the :class:`DictReader` and :class:`DictWriter` classes."

msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`csv` module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a :ref:`reader object <reader-objects>` that will process lines from "
"the given *csvfile*.  A csvfile must be an iterable of strings, each in the "
"reader's defined csv format. A csvfile is most commonly a file-like object "
"or list. If *csvfile* is a file object, it should be opened with "
"``newline=''``. [1]_  An optional *dialect* parameter can be given which is "
"used to define a set of parameters specific to a particular CSV dialect.  It "
"may be an instance of a subclass of the :class:`Dialect` class or one of the "
"strings returned by the :func:`list_dialects` function.  The other optional "
"*fmtparams* keyword arguments can be given to override individual formatting "
"parameters in the current dialect.  For full details about the dialect and "
"formatting parameters, see section :ref:`csv-fmt-params`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings.  No "
"automatic data type conversion is performed unless the :data:"
"`QUOTE_NONNUMERIC` format option is specified (in which case unquoted fields "
"are transformed into floats)."
msgstr ""

msgid "A short usage example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> import csv\n"

"Spam, Lovely Spam, Wonderful Spam"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a writer object responsible for converting the user's data into "
"delimited strings on the given file-like object.  *csvfile* can be any "
"object with a :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.write` method.  If *csvfile* is a file "
"object, it should be opened with ``newline=''`` [1]_.  An optional *dialect* "
"parameter can be given which is used to define a set of parameters specific "
"to a particular CSV dialect.  It may be an instance of a subclass of the :"
"class:`Dialect` class or one of the strings returned by the :func:"
"`list_dialects` function.  The other optional *fmtparams* keyword arguments "
"can be given to override individual formatting parameters in the current "
"dialect.  For full details about dialects and formatting parameters, see "
"the :ref:`csv-fmt-params` section. To make it as easy as possible to "
"interface with modules which implement the DB API, the value :const:`None` "
"is written as the empty string.  While this isn't a reversible "
"transformation, it makes it easier to dump SQL NULL data values to CSV files "
"without preprocessing the data returned from a ``cursor.fetch*`` call. All "
