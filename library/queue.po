msgid ":mod:`!queue` --- A synchronized queue class"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/queue.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`queue` module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues. It "
"is especially useful in threaded programming when information must be "
"exchanged safely between multiple threads.  The :class:`Queue` class in this "
"module implements all the required locking semantics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module implements three types of queue, which differ only in the order "
"in which the entries are retrieved.  In a :abbr:`FIFO (first-in, first-out)` "
"queue, the first tasks added are the first retrieved.  In a :abbr:`LIFO "
"(last-in, first-out)` queue, the most recently added entry is the first "
"retrieved (operating like a stack).  With a priority queue, the entries are "
"kept sorted (using the :mod:`heapq` module) and the lowest valued entry is "
"retrieved first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Internally, those three types of queues use locks to temporarily block "
"competing threads; however, they are not designed to handle reentrancy "
"within a thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition, the module implements a \"simple\" :abbr:`FIFO (first-in, first-"
"out)` queue type, :class:`SimpleQueue`, whose specific implementation "
"provides additional guarantees in exchange for the smaller functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`queue` module defines the following classes and exceptions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Constructor for a :abbr:`FIFO (first-in, first-out)` queue.  *maxsize* is an "
"integer that sets the upperbound limit on the number of items that can be "
"placed in the queue.  Insertion will block once this size has been reached, "
"until queue items are consumed.  If *maxsize* is less than or equal to zero, "
"the queue size is infinite."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Constructor for a :abbr:`LIFO (last-in, first-out)` queue.  *maxsize* is an "

"infinite."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The lowest valued entries are retrieved first (the lowest valued entry is "
"the one that would be returned by ``min(entries)``).  A typical pattern for "
"entries is a tuple in the form: ``(priority_number, data)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *data* elements are not comparable, the data can be wrapped in a "
"class that ignores the data item and only compares the priority number::"

msgid "Queue Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Queue objects (:class:`Queue`, :class:`LifoQueue`, or :class:"
"`PriorityQueue`) provide the public methods described below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the approximate size of the queue.  Note, qsize() > 0 doesn't "
"guarantee that a subsequent get() will not block, nor will qsize() < maxsize "
"guarantee that put() will not block."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the queue is empty, ``False`` otherwise.  If empty() "
"returns ``True`` it doesn't guarantee that a subsequent call to put() will "
"not block.  Similarly, if empty() returns ``False`` it doesn't guarantee "
"that a subsequent call to get() will not block."
msgstr ""

"a subsequent call to put() will not block."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Put *item* into the queue.  If optional args *block* is true and *timeout* "
"is ``None`` (the default), block if necessary until a free slot is "

msgid ""
"Prior to 3.0 on POSIX systems, and for all versions on Windows, if *block* "
"is true and *timeout* is ``None``, this operation goes into an "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
