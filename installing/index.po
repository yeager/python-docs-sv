"As a popular open source development project, Python has an active "
"supporting community of contributors and users that also make their software "
"available for other Python developers to use under open source license terms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This allows Python users to share and collaborate effectively, benefiting "
"from the solutions others have already created to common (and sometimes even "
"rare!) problems, as well as potentially contributing their own solutions to "
"the common pool."

"This guide covers the installation part of the process. For a guide to "
"creating and sharing your own Python projects, refer to the `Python "

"For corporate and other institutional users, be aware that many "

"source software. Please take such policies into account when making use of "

msgid "Key terms"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pip`` is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it is "
"included by default with the Python binary installers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *virtual environment* is a semi-isolated Python environment that allows "
"packages to be installed for use by a particular application, rather than "
"being installed system wide."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``venv`` is the standard tool for creating virtual environments, and has "
"been part of Python since Python 3.3. Starting with Python 3.4, it defaults "
"to installing ``pip`` into all created virtual environments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``virtualenv`` is a third party alternative (and predecessor) to ``venv``. "
"It allows virtual environments to be used on versions of Python prior to "
"3.4, which either don't provide ``venv`` at all, or aren't able to "
"automatically install ``pip`` into created environments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`__ is a public repository of "
"open source licensed packages made available for use by other Python users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"the `Python Packaging Authority <https://www.pypa.io/>`__ is the group of "
"developers and documentation authors responsible for the maintenance and "
"evolution of the standard packaging tools and the associated metadata and "
"file format standards. They maintain a variety of tools, documentation, and "
"issue trackers on `GitHub <https://github.com/pypa>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``distutils`` is the original build and distribution system first added to "
"the Python standard library in 1998. While direct use of ``distutils`` is "
"being phased out, it still laid the foundation for the current packaging and "
"distribution infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the standard "
"library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of the "
"mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards development)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The use of ``venv`` is now recommended for creating virtual environments."

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Basic usage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The standard packaging tools are all designed to be used from the command "
"line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following command will install the latest version of a module and its "
"dependencies from the Python Package Index::"
msgstr ""

msgid "python -m pip install SomePackage"
msgstr "python -m pip install NågotPaket"

msgid ""
"For POSIX users (including macOS and Linux users), the examples in this "
"guide assume the use of a :term:`virtual environment`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For Windows users, the examples in this guide assume that the option to "
"adjust the system PATH environment variable was selected when installing "
"Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's also possible to specify an exact or minimum version directly on the "
"command line. When using comparator operators such as ``>``, ``<`` or some "
"other special character which get interpreted by shell, the package name and "
"the version should be enclosed within double quotes::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"python -m pip install SomePackage==1.0.4    # specific version\n"
"python -m pip install \"SomePackage>=1.0.4\"  # minimum version"
msgstr ""
"python -m pip install NågotPaket==1.0.4 # specifik version\n"
"python -m pip install \"NågotPaket>=1.0.4\" # minsta version"

msgid ""
"Normally, if a suitable module is already installed, attempting to install "
"it again will have no effect. Upgrading existing modules must be requested "
"explicitly::"
msgstr ""

msgid "python -m pip install --upgrade SomePackage"
msgstr "python -m pip install --upgrade NågotPaket"

msgid ""
"More information and resources regarding ``pip`` and its capabilities can be "
"found in the `Python Packaging User Guide <https://packaging.python.org>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creation of virtual environments is done through the :mod:`venv` module. "
"Installing packages into an active virtual environment uses the commands "
"shown above."

msgid "How do I ...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "These are quick answers or links for some common tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "... install ``pip`` in versions of Python prior to Python 3.4?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python only started bundling ``pip`` with Python 3.4. For earlier versions, "
"``pip`` needs to be \"bootstrapped\" as described in the Python Packaging "
"User Guide."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Python Packaging User Guide: Requirements for Installing Packages <https://"
"packaging.python.org/installing/#requirements-for-installing-packages>`__"
msgstr ""

msgid "... install packages just for the current user?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Passing the ``--user`` option to ``python -m pip install`` will install a "
"package just for the current user, rather than for all users of the system."
msgstr ""

msgid "... install scientific Python packages?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A number of scientific Python packages have complex binary dependencies, and "
"aren't currently easy to install using ``pip`` directly. At this point in "
"time, it will often be easier for users to install these packages by `other "
"means <https://packaging.python.org/science/>`__ rather than attempting to "
"install them with ``pip``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Python Packaging User Guide: Installing Scientific Packages <https://"
"packaging.python.org/science/>`__"
msgstr ""

msgid "... work with multiple versions of Python installed in parallel?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Linux, macOS, and other POSIX systems, use the versioned Python commands "
"in combination with the ``-m`` switch to run the appropriate copy of "
"``pip``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"python2   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 2\n"
"python2.7 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 2.7\n"

msgid "Common installation issues"
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing into the system Python on Linux"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Linux systems, a Python installation will typically be included as part "
"of the distribution. Installing into this Python installation requires root "
"access to the system, and may interfere with the operation of the system "
"package manager and other components of the system if a component is "
"unexpectedly upgraded using ``pip``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On such systems, it is often better to use a virtual environment or a per-"
"user installation when installing packages with ``pip``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pip not installed"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible that ``pip`` does not get installed by default. One potential "
"fix is::"
msgstr ""

msgid "python -m ensurepip --default-pip"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are also additional resources for `installing pip. <https://packaging."
"python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-pip-setuptools-"
"and-wheel-are-up-to-date>`__"
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing binary extensions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python has typically relied heavily on source based distribution, with end "
"users being expected to compile extension modules from source as part of the "
"installation process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the introduction of support for the binary ``wheel`` format, and the "
"ability to publish wheels for at least Windows and macOS through the Python "
"Package Index, this problem is expected to diminish over time, as users are "
"more regularly able to install pre-built extensions rather than needing to "
"build them themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of the solutions for installing `scientific software <https://packaging."
"python.org/science/>`__ that are not yet available as pre-built ``wheel`` "
"files may also help with obtaining other binary extensions without needing "
"to build them locally."
