msgid ":mod:`!xml.sax.handler` --- Base classes for SAX handlers"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/xml/sax/handler.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The SAX API defines five kinds of handlers: content handlers, DTD handlers, "
"error handlers, entity resolvers and lexical handlers. Applications normally "
"only need to implement those interfaces whose events they are interested in; "
"they can implement the interfaces in a single object or in multiple objects. "
"Handler implementations should inherit from the base classes provided in the "
"module :mod:`xml.sax.handler`, so that all methods get default "
"implementations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the main callback interface in SAX, and the one most important to "
"applications. The order of events in this interface mirrors the order of the "
"information in the document."
msgstr ""

msgid "Handle DTD events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This interface specifies only those DTD events required for basic parsing "
"(unparsed entities and attributes)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Basic interface for resolving entities. If you create an object implementing "
"this interface, then register the object with your Parser, the parser will "
"call the method in your object to resolve all external entities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Interface used by the parser to present error and warning messages to the "
"application.  The methods of this object control whether errors are "
"immediately converted to exceptions or are handled in some other way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Interface used by the parser to represent low frequency events which may not "
"be of interest to many applications."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to these classes, :mod:`xml.sax.handler` provides symbolic "

msgid "ContentHandler Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users are expected to subclass :class:`ContentHandler` to support their "
"application.  The following methods are called by the parser on the "
"appropriate events in the input document:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Called by the parser to give the application a locator for locating the "
"origin of document events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely required) to "
"supply a locator: if it does so, it must supply the locator to the "
"application by invoking this method before invoking any of the other methods "
"in the DocumentHandler interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The locator allows the application to determine the end position of any "
"document-related event, even if the parser is not reporting an error. "
"Typically, the application will use this information for reporting its own "
"errors (such as character content that does not match an application's "
"business rules). The information returned by the locator is probably not "
"sufficient for use with a search engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the locator will return correct information only during the "
"invocation of the events in this interface. The application should not "
"attempt to use it at any other time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Receive notification of the beginning of a document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, before any other methods "
"in this interface or in DTDHandler (except for :meth:`setDocumentLocator`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Receive notification of the end of a document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, and it will be the last "
"method invoked during the parse. The parser shall not invoke this method "
"until it has either abandoned parsing (because of an unrecoverable error) or "
"reached the end of input."
msgstr ""

msgid "Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The information from this event is not necessary for normal Namespace "
"processing: the SAX XML reader will automatically replace prefixes for "
"element and attribute names when the ``feature_namespaces`` feature is "
"enabled (the default)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are cases, however, when applications need to use prefixes in "
"character data or in attribute values, where they cannot safely be expanded "
"automatically; the :meth:`startPrefixMapping` and :meth:`endPrefixMapping` "
"events supply the information to the application to expand prefixes in those "
"contexts itself, if necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that :meth:`startPrefixMapping` and :meth:`endPrefixMapping` events are "
"not guaranteed to be properly nested relative to each-other: all :meth:"
"`startPrefixMapping` events will occur before the corresponding :meth:"
"`startElement` event, and all :meth:`endPrefixMapping` events will occur "
"after the corresponding :meth:`endElement` event, but their order is not "
"guaranteed."
msgstr ""

msgid "End the scope of a prefix-URI mapping."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :meth:`startPrefixMapping` for details. This event will always occur "
"after the corresponding :meth:`endElement` event, but the order of :meth:"
"`endPrefixMapping` events is not otherwise guaranteed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals the start of an element in non-namespace mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *name* parameter contains the raw XML 1.0 name of the element type as a "
"string and the *attrs* parameter holds an object of the :class:`~xml.sax."
"xmlreader.Attributes` interface (see :ref:`attributes-objects`) containing "
"the attributes of the element.  The object passed as *attrs* may be re-used "
"by the parser; holding on to a reference to it is not a reliable way to keep "
"a copy of the attributes. To keep a copy of the attributes, use the :meth:"
"`copy` method of the *attrs* object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals the end of an element in non-namespace mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *name* parameter contains the name of the element type, just as with "
"the :meth:`startElement` event."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals the start of an element in namespace mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *name* parameter contains the name of the element type as a ``(uri, "
"localname)`` tuple, the *qname* parameter contains the raw XML 1.0 name used "
"in the source document, and the *attrs* parameter holds an instance of the :"
"class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.AttributesNS` interface (see :ref:`attributes-ns-"
"objects`) containing the attributes of the element.  If no namespace is "
"associated with the element, the *uri* component of *name* will be "
"``None``.  The object passed as *attrs* may be re-used by the parser; "
"holding on to a reference to it is not a reliable way to keep a copy of the "
"attributes.  To keep a copy of the attributes, use the :meth:`copy` method "
"of the *attrs* object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Parsers may set the *qname* parameter to ``None``, unless the "
"``feature_namespace_prefixes`` feature is activated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals the end of an element in namespace mode."

"The *name* parameter contains the name of the element type, just as with "
"the :meth:`startElementNS` method, likewise the *qname* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Receive notification of character data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Parser will call this method to report each chunk of character data. SAX "
"parsers may return all contiguous character data in a single chunk, or they "
"may split it into several chunks; however, all of the characters in any "
"single event must come from the same external entity so that the Locator "
"provides useful information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*content* may be a string or bytes instance; the ``expat`` reader module "
"always produces strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The earlier SAX 1 interface provided by the Python XML Special Interest "
"Group used a more Java-like interface for this method.  Since most parsers "
"used from Python did not take advantage of the older interface, the simpler "
"signature was chosen to replace it.  To convert old code to the new "
"interface, use *content* instead of slicing content with the old *offset* "
"and *length* parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Validating Parsers must use this method to report each chunk of ignorable "
"whitespace (see the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation, section 2.10): non-"
"validating parsers may also use this method if they are capable of parsing "
"and using content models."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SAX parsers may return all contiguous whitespace in a single chunk, or they "

msgstr ""

msgid "Receive notification of a processing instruction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Parser will invoke this method once for each processing instruction "
"found: note that processing instructions may occur before or after the main "
"document element."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Receive notification of a skipped entity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Parser will invoke this method once for each entity skipped. Non-"
"validating processors may skip entities if they have not seen the "
"declarations (because, for example, the entity was declared in an external "
"DTD subset). All processors may skip external entities, depending on the "
"values of the ``feature_external_ges`` and the ``feature_external_pes`` "
"properties."
msgstr ""

msgid "DTDHandler Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`DTDHandler` instances provide the following methods:"

msgid "EntityResolver Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Resolve the system identifier of an entity and return either the system "

msgstr ""

msgid "ErrorHandler Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects with this interface are used to receive error and warning "
"information from the :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader`.  If you create "
"an object that implements this interface, then register the object with "
"your :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader`, the parser will call the methods "
"in your object to report all warnings and errors. There are three levels of "
"errors available: warnings, (possibly) recoverable errors, and unrecoverable "
"errors.  All methods take a :exc:`~xml.sax.SAXParseException` as the only "
"parameter.  Errors and warnings may be converted to an exception by raising "
"the passed-in exception object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Called when the parser encounters a recoverable error.  If this method does "
"not raise an exception, parsing may continue, but further document "
"information should not be expected by the application.  Allowing the parser "

"document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Called when the parser encounters an error it cannot recover from; parsing "
"is expected to terminate when this method returns."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Called when the parser presents minor warning information to the "
"application. Parsing is expected to continue when this method returns, and "
