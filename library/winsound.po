msgid ":mod:`!winsound` --- Sound-playing interface for Windows"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`winsound` module provides access to the basic sound-playing "
"machinery provided by Windows platforms.  It includes functions and several "
"constants."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Beep the PC's speaker. The *frequency* parameter specifies frequency, in "
"hertz, of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The "
"*duration* parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should "
"last.  If the system is not able to beep the speaker, :exc:`RuntimeError` is "
"raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call the underlying :c:func:`!PlaySound` function from the Platform API.  "
"The *sound* parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as "
"a :term:`bytes-like object`, or ``None``.  Its interpretation depends on the "
"value of *flags*, which can be a bitwise ORed combination of the constants "
"described below. If the *sound* parameter is ``None``, any currently playing "
"waveform sound is stopped. If the system indicates an error, :exc:"
"`RuntimeError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call the underlying :c:func:`!MessageBeep` function from the Platform API.  "
"This plays a sound as specified in the registry.  The *type* argument "
"specifies which sound to play; possible values are ``-1``, "
"``MB_ICONASTERISK``, ``MB_ICONEXCLAMATION``, ``MB_ICONHAND``, "
"``MB_ICONQUESTION``, and ``MB_OK``, all described below.  The value ``-1`` "
"produces a \"simple beep\"; this is the final fallback if a sound cannot be "
"played otherwise.  If the system indicates an error, :exc:`RuntimeError` is "
"raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *sound* parameter is the name of a WAV file. Do not use with :const:"
"`SND_ALIAS`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *sound* parameter is a sound association name from the registry.  If the "
"registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless :const:"
"`SND_NODEFAULT` is also specified. If no default sound is registered, raise :"
"exc:`RuntimeError`. Do not use with :const:`SND_FILENAME`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All Win32 systems support at least the following; most systems support many "
"more:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":func:`PlaySound` *name*"
msgstr ""

msgid "Corresponding Control Panel Sound name"
msgstr ""

msgid "``'SystemAsterisk'``"

msgid ""
"import winsound\n"
"# Play Windows exit sound.\n"
"winsound.PlaySound(\"SystemExit\", winsound.SND_ALIAS)\n"

"# Probably play Windows default sound, if any is registered (because\n"
"# \"*\" probably isn't the registered name of any sound).\n"
"winsound.PlaySound(\"*\", winsound.SND_ALIAS)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Play the sound repeatedly.  The :const:`SND_ASYNC` flag must also be used to "
"avoid blocking.  Cannot be used with :const:`SND_MEMORY`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *sound* parameter to :func:`PlaySound` is a memory image of a WAV file, "
"as a :term:`bytes-like object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not support playing from a memory image asynchronously, so "
"a combination of this flag and :const:`SND_ASYNC` will raise :exc:"
"`RuntimeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stop playing all instances of the specified sound."
msgstr ""

msgid "This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play the system default sound."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not interrupt sounds currently playing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return immediately if the sound driver is busy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *sound* parameter is an application-specific alias in the registry. This "
"flag can be combined with the :const:`SND_ALIAS` flag to specify an "
"application-defined sound alias."
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers a SoundSentry event when the sound is played."
msgstr ""

msgid "The sound is played synchronously.  This is the default behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "Assign the sound to the audio session for system notification sounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Play the ``SystemDefault`` sound."
msgstr ""

msgid "Play the ``SystemExclamation`` sound."
msgstr ""

msgid "Play the ``SystemHand`` sound."

msgid "Play the ``SystemQuestion`` sound."
