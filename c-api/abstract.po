"The functions in this chapter interact with Python objects regardless of "
"their type, or with wide classes of object types (e.g. all numerical types, "
"or all sequence types).  When used on object types for which they do not "
"apply, they will raise a Python exception."

"It is not possible to use these functions on objects that are not properly "
"initialized, such as a list object that has been created by :c:func:"

"value yet."
