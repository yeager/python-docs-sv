msgid "Iterator Objects"

msgid ""
"Python provides two general-purpose iterator objects.  The first, a sequence "
"iterator, works with an arbitrary sequence supporting the :meth:`~object."
"__getitem__` method.  The second works with a callable object and a sentinel "
"value, calling the callable for each item in the sequence, and ending the "
"iteration when the sentinel value is returned."

"Type object for iterator objects returned by :c:func:`PySeqIter_New` and the "
"one-argument form of the :func:`iter` built-in function for built-in "
"sequence types."

"Return an iterator that works with a general sequence object, *seq*.  The "

"Return a new iterator.  The first parameter, *callable*, can be any Python "
"callable object that can be called with no parameters; each call to it "
"should return the next item in the iteration.  When *callable* returns a "
"value equal to *sentinel*, the iteration will be terminated."
