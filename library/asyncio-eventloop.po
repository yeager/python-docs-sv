msgid "Event Loop"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Source code:** :source:`Lib/asyncio/events.py`, :source:`Lib/asyncio/"
"base_events.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Preface"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The event loop is the core of every asyncio application. Event loops run "
"asynchronous tasks and callbacks, perform network IO operations, and run "
"subprocesses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Application developers should typically use the high-level asyncio "
"functions, such as :func:`asyncio.run`, and should rarely need to reference "
"the loop object or call its methods.  This section is intended mostly for "
"authors of lower-level code, libraries, and frameworks, who need finer "
"control over the event loop behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "Obtaining the Event Loop"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following low-level functions can be used to get, set, or create an "
"event loop:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the running event loop in the current OS thread."
msgstr ""

msgid "Raise a :exc:`RuntimeError` if there is no running event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "This function can only be called from a coroutine or a callback."
msgstr ""

msgid "Get the current event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When called from a coroutine or a callback (e.g. scheduled with call_soon or "
"similar API), this function will always return the running event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there is no running event loop set, the function will return the result "
"of the ``get_event_loop_policy().get_event_loop()`` call."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because this function has rather complex behavior (especially when custom "
"event loop policies are in use), using the :func:`get_running_loop` function "
"is preferred to :func:`get_event_loop` in coroutines and callbacks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As noted above, consider using the higher-level :func:`asyncio.run` "
"function, instead of using these lower level functions to manually create "
"and close an event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Raises a :exc:`RuntimeError` if there is no current event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`!asyncio` policy system is deprecated and will be removed in "
"Python 3.16; from there on, this function will return the current running "
"event loop if present else it will return the loop set by :func:"
"`set_event_loop`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set *loop* as the current event loop for the current OS thread."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create and return a new event loop object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the behaviour of :func:`get_event_loop`, :func:`set_event_loop`, "
"and :func:`new_event_loop` functions can be altered by :ref:`setting a "
"custom event loop policy <asyncio-policies>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Contents"
msgstr ""

msgid "This documentation page contains the following sections:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Event Loop Methods`_ section is the reference documentation of the "
"event loop APIs;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Callback Handles`_ section documents the :class:`Handle` and :class:"
"`TimerHandle` instances which are returned from scheduling methods such as :"
"meth:`loop.call_soon` and :meth:`loop.call_later`;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Server Objects`_ section documents types returned from event loop "
"methods like :meth:`loop.create_server`;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Event Loop Implementations`_ section documents the :class:"
"`SelectorEventLoop` and :class:`ProactorEventLoop` classes;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Examples`_ section showcases how to work with some event loop APIs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Event Loop Methods"
msgstr ""

msgid "Event loops have **low-level** APIs for the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Running and stopping the loop"
msgstr ""

msgid "Run until the *future* (an instance of :class:`Future`) has completed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the argument is a :ref:`coroutine object <coroutine>` it is implicitly "
"scheduled to run as a :class:`asyncio.Task`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the Future's result or raise its exception."
msgstr ""

msgid "Run the event loop until :meth:`stop` is called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :meth:`stop` is called before :meth:`run_forever` is called, the loop "
"will poll the I/O selector once with a timeout of zero, run all callbacks "
"scheduled in response to I/O events (and those that were already scheduled), "
"and then exit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :meth:`stop` is called while :meth:`run_forever` is running, the loop "
"will run the current batch of callbacks and then exit. Note that new "
"callbacks scheduled by callbacks will not run in this case; instead, they "
"will run the next time :meth:`run_forever` or :meth:`run_until_complete` is "
"called."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stop the event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return ``True`` if the event loop is currently running."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return ``True`` if the event loop was closed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Close the event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The loop must not be running when this function is called. Any pending "
"callbacks will be discarded."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method clears all queues and shuts down the executor, but does not wait "
"for the executor to finish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is idempotent and irreversible.  No other methods should be "
"called after the event loop is closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Schedule all currently open :term:`asynchronous generator` objects to close "
"with an :meth:`~agen.aclose` call.  After calling this method, the event "
"loop will issue a warning if a new asynchronous generator is iterated. This "
"should be used to reliably finalize all scheduled asynchronous generators."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that there is no need to call this function when :func:`asyncio.run` is "
"used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"try:\n"
"    loop.run_forever()\n"
"finally:\n"
"    loop.run_until_complete(loop.shutdown_asyncgens())\n"
"    loop.close()"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Schedule the closure of the default executor and wait for it to join all of "
"the threads in the :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. Once "
"this method has been called, using the default executor with :meth:`loop."
"run_in_executor` will raise a :exc:`RuntimeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *timeout* parameter specifies the amount of time (in :class:`float` "
"seconds) the executor will be given to finish joining. With the default, "
"``None``, the executor is allowed an unlimited amount of time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *timeout* is reached, a :exc:`RuntimeWarning` is emitted and the "
"default executor is terminated without waiting for its threads to finish "
"joining."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not call this method when using :func:`asyncio.run`, as the latter "
"handles default executor shutdown automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *timeout* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scheduling callbacks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Schedule the *callback* :term:`callback` to be called with *args* arguments "
"at the next iteration of the event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return an instance of :class:`asyncio.Handle`, which can be used later to "
"cancel the callback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Callbacks are called in the order in which they are registered. Each "
"callback will be called exactly once."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The optional keyword-only *context* argument specifies a custom :class:"
"`contextvars.Context` for the *callback* to run in. Callbacks use the "
"current context when no *context* is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unlike :meth:`call_soon_threadsafe`, this method is not thread-safe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A thread-safe variant of :meth:`call_soon`. When scheduling callbacks from "
"another thread, this function *must* be used, since :meth:`call_soon` is not "
"thread-safe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is safe to be called from a reentrant context or signal "
"handler, however, it is not safe or fruitful to use the returned handle in "
"such contexts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`RuntimeError` if called on a loop that's been closed. This can "
"happen on a secondary thread when the main application is shutting down."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`concurrency and multithreading <asyncio-multithreading>` "
"section of the documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *context* keyword-only parameter was added. See :pep:`567` for more "
"details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most :mod:`asyncio` scheduling functions don't allow passing keyword "
"arguments.  To do that, use :func:`functools.partial`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"# will schedule \"print(\"Hello\", flush=True)\"\n"
"loop.call_soon(\n"
"    functools.partial(print, \"Hello\", flush=True))"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using partial objects is usually more convenient than using lambdas, as "
"asyncio can render partial objects better in debug and error messages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scheduling delayed callbacks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Event loop provides mechanisms to schedule callback functions to be called "
"at some point in the future.  Event loop uses monotonic clocks to track time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Schedule *callback* to be called after the given *delay* number of seconds "
"(can be either an int or a float)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An instance of :class:`asyncio.TimerHandle` is returned which can be used to "
"cancel the callback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*callback* will be called exactly once.  If two callbacks are scheduled for "
"exactly the same time, the order in which they are called is undefined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The optional positional *args* will be passed to the callback when it is "
"called. If you want the callback to be called with keyword arguments use :"
"func:`functools.partial`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a custom :"
"class:`contextvars.Context` for the *callback* to run in. The current "
"context is used when no *context* is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For performance, callbacks scheduled with :meth:`loop.call_later` may run up "
"to one clock-resolution early (see ``time.get_clock_info('monotonic')."
"resolution``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Python 3.7 and earlier with the default event loop implementation, the "
"*delay* could not exceed one day. This has been fixed in Python 3.8."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Schedule *callback* to be called at the given absolute timestamp *when* (an "
"int or a float), using the same time reference as :meth:`loop.time`."
msgstr ""

msgid "This method's behavior is the same as :meth:`call_later`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For performance, callbacks scheduled with :meth:`loop.call_at` may run up to "
"one clock-resolution early (see ``time.get_clock_info('monotonic')."
"resolution``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Python 3.7 and earlier with the default event loop implementation, the "
"difference between *when* and the current time could not exceed one day.  "
"This has been fixed in Python 3.8."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the current time, as a :class:`float` value, according to the event "
"loop's internal monotonic clock."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Python 3.7 and earlier timeouts (relative *delay* or absolute *when*) "
"should not exceed one day.  This has been fixed in Python 3.8."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :func:`asyncio.sleep` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating Futures and Tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create an :class:`asyncio.Future` object attached to the event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the preferred way to create Futures in asyncio. This lets third-"
"party event loops provide alternative implementations of the Future object "
"(with better performance or instrumentation)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Schedule the execution of :ref:`coroutine <coroutine>` *coro*. Return a :"
"class:`Task` object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Third-party event loops can use their own subclass of :class:`Task` for "
"interoperability. In this case, the result type is a subclass of :class:"
"`Task`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The full function signature is largely the same as that of the :class:`Task` "
"constructor (or factory) - all of the keyword arguments to this function are "
"passed through to that interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *name* argument is provided and not ``None``, it is set as the name "
"of the task using :meth:`Task.set_name`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a custom :"
"class:`contextvars.Context` for the *coro* to run in. The current context "
"copy is created when no *context* is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An optional keyword-only *eager_start* argument allows specifying if the "
"task should execute eagerly during the call to create_task, or be scheduled "
"later. If *eager_start* is not passed the mode set by :meth:`loop."
"set_task_factory` will be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *name* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *context* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Added ``kwargs`` which passes on arbitrary extra parameters, including  "
"``name`` and ``context``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rolled back the change that passes on *name* and *context* (if it is None), "
"while still passing on other arbitrary keyword arguments (to avoid breaking "
"backwards compatibility with 3.13.3)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All *kwargs* are now passed on. The *eager_start* parameter works with eager "
"task factories."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set a task factory that will be used by :meth:`loop.create_task`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *factory* is ``None`` the default task factory will be set. Otherwise, "
"*factory* must be a *callable* with the signature matching ``(loop, coro, "
"**kwargs)``, where *loop* is a reference to the active event loop, and "
"*coro* is a coroutine object.  The callable must pass on all *kwargs*, and "
"return a :class:`asyncio.Task`-compatible object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Required that all *kwargs* are passed on to :class:`asyncio.Task`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*name* is no longer passed to task factories. *context* is no longer passed "
"to task factories if it is ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*name* and *context* are now unconditionally passed on to task factories "
"again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return a task factory or ``None`` if the default one is in use."
msgstr ""

msgid "Opening network connections"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open a streaming transport connection to a given address specified by *host* "
"and *port*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*protocol_factory* must be a callable returning an :ref:`asyncio protocol "
"<asyncio-protocol>` implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method will try to establish the connection in the background. When "
"successful, it returns a ``(transport, protocol)`` pair."
msgstr ""

msgid "The chronological synopsis of the underlying operation is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The connection is established and a :ref:`transport <asyncio-transport>` is "
"created for it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*protocol_factory* is called without arguments and is expected to return a :"
